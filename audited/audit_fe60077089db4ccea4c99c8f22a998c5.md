I cannot proceed with the security audit because the specific investigation target has not been provided. The query shows placeholder text:

**"[File: ...] [Function: functionName()] [Vulnerability Type] ..."**

To conduct a security audit, I need you to specify:

1. **File path**: Which contract file should I investigate?
2. **Function name**: Which specific function should I analyze?
3. **Vulnerability type**: What type of security issue should I look for? (e.g., access control, reentrancy, arithmetic overflow, authorization bypass, etc.)

**Example of a properly formatted query:**
```
[File: src/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract.cs] 
[Function: Transfer()] 
[Vulnerability Type: Missing balance check]
```

Once you provide these details, I can:
- Search for the relevant code
- Trace execution paths
- Validate invariants
- Check for the specified vulnerability
- Provide a complete audit report if a valid issue is found

Please specify the file, function, and vulnerability type you'd like me to investigate.
