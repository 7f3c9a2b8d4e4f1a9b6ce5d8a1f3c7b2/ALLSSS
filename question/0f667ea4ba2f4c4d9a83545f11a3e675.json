  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Empty Fees Array] If input.Fees is an empty array, will the foreach loop at line 13 pass without validating any tokens, allowing empty fee configurations that violate economic assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Duplicate Method Names] Can multiple fee configurations exist for the same method name with different capitalization or whitespace, causing confusion in fee lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Maximum Fee Limit] Is there any upper bound check on methodFee.BasicFee to prevent setting astronomically high fees that make transactions impossible? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Array Size] Is there a limit on the size of input.Fees array to prevent memory exhaustion or excessive gas consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Self-Reference] Can input.ContractAddress be set to the EconomicContract's own address, creating a self-referential validation loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Method Name Case Sensitivity] Is the method name lookup at line 37 case-sensitive, and can this cause mismatches between how fees are set and retrieved? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: CheckOrganizationExist()] [Contract Upgrade] If authorityInfo.ContractAddress points to an upgradeable contract that changes its ValidateOrganizationExist implementation, can this retroactively invalidate existing controllers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Token Contract Upgrade] If the Token contract is upgraded and changes its IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee logic, can this invalidate previously set fees or allow new attack vectors? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Parliament Contract Swap] Can an attacker deploy a malicious contract with the Parliament contract's name before the Economic contract initializes, causing GetContractAddressByName to return the malicious address? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Contract Address Validation] None of the cross-contract calls validate that the target address is actually a contract - can this cause failures or exploits when calling non-contract addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Symbol Conflicts] Can the controller set fees in multiple different tokens for the same method, and how does the system determine which token to collect? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Zero Fee Bypass] Can setting fees with amount=0 for all tokens effectively make a method free, bypassing the economic model's fee requirements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Token Availability] If a token used for fees becomes unavailable (delisted, blacklisted), what happens to transactions that need to pay fees in that token? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Fee Collection Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the gap between fee configuration (SetMethodFee) and actual fee collection to avoid paying fees by front-running fee updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Missing Fees] What happens when GetMethodFee returns null for a method - does the transaction fail, use a default fee, or proceed for free? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [MEV Front-Running] Can miners or validators front-run SetMethodFee() transactions to execute transactions with old fee rates before new rates take effect, extracting MEV? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [MEV Sandwich] Can an attacker sandwich a ChangeMethodFeeController() transaction with SetMethodFee() calls to set malicious fees before and after the controller change? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Reentrancy Chain] Can AssertValidToken() → TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee() create a reentrancy chain if the TokenContract calls back into EconomicContract during validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: CheckOrganizationExist()] [Cross-Contract Reentrancy] Can the organization contract at authorityInfo.ContractAddress reenter EconomicContract during ValidateOrganizationExist, exploiting the state before ChangeMethodFeeController completes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker provide input.Fees with thousands of entries to make SetMethodFee() consume maximum gas, pricing out legitimate fee updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [External Call DOS] If TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee() deliberately consumes excessive gas or reverts, can this DOS all SetMethodFee() calls? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: CheckOrganizationExist()] [Validation DOS] Can a malicious organization contract consume excessive gas during ValidateOrganizationExist to DOS controller changes? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Single Point of Failure] The controller at State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress has complete control over fees - is there any emergency mechanism if this organization is compromised?
