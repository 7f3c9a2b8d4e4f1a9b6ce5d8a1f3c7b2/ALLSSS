  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [State Desync Risk] Since GetMethodFee() returns hardcoded values instead of reading State.TransactionFees[input.Value], can this cause desynchronization where governance believes fees are updated but runtime still uses hardcoded values? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Missing IsSizeFeeFree Flag] Does GetMethodFee() fail to set the IsSizeFeeFree flag for any methods, meaning all NFT operations including view methods might incorrectly charge transaction size fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Null Input Handling] Does GetMethodFee() fail to validate that input.Value is non-null before the string comparison on line 22, potentially causing NullReferenceException? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Symbol List Missing] Does GetMethodFee() only return a single MethodFee with one Symbol, while other contracts support multiple fee symbols (e.g., pay in ELF or other tokens), limiting payment flexibility? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Method Name Typo Risk] If the Create method is renamed or has different casing in the actual contract implementation, would GetMethodFee() fail to return fees since it uses nameof(Create) which resolves at compile time? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Empty Controller Return] Does GetMethodFeeController() return an empty AuthorityInfo with null OwnerAddress and ContractAddress, meaning callers receive invalid controller data that cannot be used for authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Missing RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet] Does the absence of RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() mean the controller is never initialized to Parliament's default organization, leaving the contract without proper governance oversight? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [State Variable Missing] Since there's no State.MethodFeeController in NFTContractState.cs and GetMethodFeeController() returns empty, does this mean no actual controller exists and the contract is ungovernable via standard ACS1 mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Integration Failure Risk] Can external governance tools that call GetMethodFeeController() receive empty AuthorityInfo and fail to display proper controller information, breaking governance UIs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Parliament Integration Broken] Does the lack of State.ParliamentContract.GetDefaultOrganizationAddress.Call() mean the NFT contract is never properly integrated with Parliament governance system? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Authorization Query Failure] Can authorization contracts trying to validate if an address controls NFT method fees fail because GetMethodFeeController() returns empty data rather than actual controller address? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Default Value Confusion] Does returning 'new AuthorityInfo()' instead of null create ambiguity where callers can't distinguish between 'no controller set' and 'controller is Address.Zero'? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Audit Trail Gap] Does the empty return mean there's no way to audit who has authority over NFT method fees, creating accountability gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee(), GetMethodFee()] [State Inconsistency] Can SetMethodFee() be called successfully (returns Empty without error) while GetMethodFee() continues returning hardcoded values, creating false perception that fee updates work? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController(), GetMethodFeeController()] [Controller Desync] Can ChangeMethodFeeController() accept valid input and return success while GetMethodFeeController() still returns empty, causing governance systems to believe controller was updated? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All ACS1 Methods] [Missing State Variables] Since NFTContractState.cs has no State.MethodFeeController or State.TransactionFees mappings, are all ACS1 methods fundamentally non-functional stub implementations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All ACS1 Methods] [ACS1 Compliance Violation] Do the stub implementations violate ACS1 standard expectations where SetMethodFee should 'override all fees of the method' and ChangeMethodFeeController should 'change the method fee controller'? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee(), GetMethodFee()] [Race Condition Potential] If SetMethodFee() is ever properly implemented with state writes, could the lack of ReentrancyGuard allow an attacker to call GetMethodFee() mid-update to observe intermediate states? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Fixed Fee Economic Risk] Does the hardcoded 100 ELF Create fee remain constant regardless of ELF price volatility, potentially making NFT creation too expensive during price appreciation or too cheap during depreciation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Fee Collection Bypass] If other NFT methods (Mint, Transfer, Burn, etc.) return empty MethodFees, do they bypass fee collection entirely, allowing free operations that should incur costs? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Treasury Revenue Loss] Does the non-functional SetMethodFee() prevent governance from adjusting fees to optimize Treasury revenue during high NFT usage periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Spam Prevention Failure] If minting/transfer operations have no fees (empty MethodFees), can attackers spam the NFT contract with zero-cost operations causing state bloat? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [Method Fee Provider Failure] Does the entire ACS1 implementation being non-functional mean the NFT contract cannot participate in the method fee provider system, breaking integration with Treasury/Profit contracts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Governance DOS via Stub] Can malicious proposals calling SetMethodFee() pass through Parliament and execute successfully (return Empty) but never take effect, wasting governance resources on ineffective proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [String Comparison DOS] Can an attacker repeatedly call GetMethodFee() with long input.Value strings causing string comparison overhead on line 22, though this is likely negligible? (Low)"
