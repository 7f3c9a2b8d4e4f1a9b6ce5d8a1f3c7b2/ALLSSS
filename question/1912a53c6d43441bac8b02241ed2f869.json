  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Data Integrity] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers collection is modified during Count() iteration (by concurrent transaction), could count return incorrect value affecting validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Data Integrity] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers is a mutable collection and gets modified during Contains() search, could authorization check produce inconsistent results? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Data Integrity] If Empty() returns true but whitelist is later modified before validation completes, could organization be created with different whitelist than validated? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Type Safety] If address parameter or proposerWhiteList.Proposers elements are of incompatible Address subtypes, does Contains() comparison work correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Business Logic] When Empty() returns true during Validate(), this should prevent organization creation, but if organization already exists from previous transaction, does validation get skipped? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Business Logic] When Contains() returns true for proposer authorization, if the proposer is in whitelist but is a contract address or system address, does this enable unauthorized system-level proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Business Logic] If Contains() checks succeed but proposer's address is the same as organization address, could organization propose to itself, bypassing intended governance separation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Equality] Does Contains() use Address.Equals() or == operator, and if Equals() is overridden incorrectly in Address type, could authorization checks fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Equality] If Address implements IEquatable incorrectly with case-sensitive byte comparison when addresses should be case-insensitive, could identical addresses fail Contains() check? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Memory] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers references extremely large collection that's lazy-loaded, does Count() force full materialization causing out-of-memory? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Memory] Does Contains() create defensive copies of address parameter or collection elements during comparison, causing excessive memory allocation for large whitelists? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Logic Error] If calling code incorrectly inverts Empty() return value (checking for !Empty() when should check Empty()), could this allow empty whitelists in organizations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Logic Error] If AssertIsAuthorizedProposer incorrectly negates Contains() result, could this invert authorization logic, denying legitimate proposers and allowing unauthorized ones? (Critical)",
