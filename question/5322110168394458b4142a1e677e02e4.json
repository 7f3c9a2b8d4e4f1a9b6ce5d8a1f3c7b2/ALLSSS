  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Vote() Quadratic] [Cost Calculation] At line 102, amount = votingItem.TicketCost.Mul(currentVotesCount) - can an attacker exploit that cost is linear in vote count rather than quadratic, enabling cheaper vote buying than intended in quadratic voting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Vote() Quadratic] [Vote Count Persistence] QuadraticVotesCountMap at line 100 persists across withdrawals - if an attacker votes, withdraws, then votes again with the same VoteId, does the count continue incrementing or reset? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Vote() Quadratic] [Amount Handling] In quadratic voting at line 99-102, the calculated amount is used for locking at line 129, but UpdateVotingResult at line 119 receives '1' not 'amount' - can this cause mismatch between locked tokens and recorded votes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Vote() Quadratic] [Integer Precision] The multiplication at line 102 of TicketCost * currentVotesCount can lose precision if TicketCost has decimal places - can this cause rounding errors that accumulate over many votes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Vote() Quadratic] [Sybil Resistance] Can an attacker create many VoteIds and vote once with each to bypass the increasing cost of quadratic voting, since each VoteId starts with QuadraticVotesCountMap[voteId]=0? (Critical)"
