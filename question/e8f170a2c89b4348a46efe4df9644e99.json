  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Debt Manipulation] If individual ArrearsInfo entries contain negative values due to accounting errors, can this reduce total reported debt below actual amount, enabling unpaid indexing? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Debt Persistence] Are debts properly persisted across chain restarts and reorganizations, or can debt information be lost allowing chains to avoid payment? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Concurrent Debt Updates] If debts are modified during query execution, can race conditions return inconsistent debt amounts that don't match actual arrears state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Serial Number Overflow] If State.SideChainSerialNumber exceeds safe integer limits, can the loop (i = 1; i <= serialNumber) iterate excessively causing gas exhaustion or timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Terminated Chain Filtering] Does skipping terminated chains create gaps in the returned dictionary that could confuse callers expecting contiguous chain ID mapping? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [GetChainId Collision] Can GetChainId(i) return duplicate chain IDs for different serial numbers, causing the dictionary Add operation to fail or overwrite previous entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Height Inconsistency] If State.CurrentSideChainHeight is not atomically updated with chain status changes, can this return heights for chains transitioning to terminated status? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [DOS via Large Serial Number] Can an attacker create excessive side chains to inflate SideChainSerialNumber, causing this function to exceed gas limits when iterating through all chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Zero Height Handling] Does including chains with height = 0 (unindexed) in the dictionary cause issues in callers that assume all returned chains have indexed blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Parent Chain Duplication] If State.ParentChainId somehow duplicates a side chain ID already in the dictionary, does dict.IdHeightDict.Add fail, causing transaction reversion? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Invalid Parent Height] Does Assert(parentChainHeight > AElfConstants.GenesisBlockHeight) properly validate parent height, or can it be exactly equal to genesis height causing off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Main Chain Scenario] When called on main chain (ParentChainId == 0), does returning only side chains without indicating 'this is main chain' confuse callers expecting complete chain topology? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Height Staleness] If parent chain height is significantly stale compared to side chain heights, does this create temporal inconsistency in cross-chain operation validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Dictionary Capacity] If the number of chains is very large, can dictionary operations cause excessive memory allocation or gas consumption? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingInformationList()] [List Ordering] Is the order of chains in IndexingInformationList deterministic, or can non-deterministic ordering cause consensus issues when multiple nodes compare results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingInformationList()] [Missing Metadata] Does the function include additional metadata like indexing status or last update timestamp, or can callers misinterpret outdated indexing information as current? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingInformationList()] [Empty List Handling] If no side chains exist, does returning an empty list cause issues in callers that don't handle empty collections properly? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingInformationList()] [Data Consistency] Are ChainId and IndexedHeight guaranteed to be consistent snapshots, or can race conditions return mismatched pairs during concurrent updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainCreator()] [Creator Address Validation] Is info.Proposer address validated to be non-zero and valid, or can returning zero address or invalid address cause authorization bypass in caller logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainCreator()] [Creator Change] If side chain creator/proposer can be changed after creation, does this function return the original creator or current controller, potentially confusing ownership-based logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainCreator()] [Privacy Concern] Does exposing creator addresses for all chains enable targeted attacks or social engineering against side chain operators? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainInitializationData()] [Data Tampering] If State.SideChainInitializationData is not integrity-protected, can malicious actors modify initialization data to corrupt newly created side chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainInitializationData()] [Sensitive Data Exposure] Does ChainInitializationData contain sensitive keys, seeds, or configuration that should not be publicly queryable? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainInitializationData()] [Immutability] Can initialization data be modified after side chain creation, potentially allowing retroactive changes that break chain security assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainInitializationData()] [Data Completeness] Does the returned data include all necessary initialization parameters, or can missing fields cause incomplete side chain setup? (Medium)"
