  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateAdmins] [Admin Takeover] Can CandidateAdmins mapping be manipulated to change a candidate's admin to an attacker's address, allowing unauthorized control over candidate operations like QuitElection or ReplaceCandidatePubkey? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateAdmins] [Admin Loop] Could an admin in CandidateAdmins also be a candidate themselves, creating circular dependencies that could be exploited to bypass permission checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateAdmins] [Orphaned Admin] When a candidate is banned or removed, is their entry in CandidateAdmins properly cleaned up, or can stale admin relationships persist causing permission issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap] [Managed Pubkeys Overflow] Can ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap allow an admin to manage unlimited candidates, and could excessive entries cause DoS when iterating through managed pubkeys? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap] [Duplicate Managed Entries] Can the same pubkey be added to ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap multiple times for the same admin, causing confusion during admin changes or quit operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap] [Admin Pubkey Conflict] When an admin becomes a candidate themselves, is there proper validation to prevent conflicts in ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap where they manage their own pubkey? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateReplacementMap] [Replacement Chain Attack] Can CandidateReplacementMap create circular replacement chains where pubkey A replaces B, B replaces C, and C replaces A, breaking pubkey resolution logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateReplacementMap] [Replacement Overwrite] Could multiple replacements for the same old pubkey in CandidateReplacementMap cause loss of replacement history, making old votes unresolvable? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialPubkeyMap] [Initial Pubkey Manipulation] Can InitialPubkeyMap be modified to point to incorrect initial pubkeys, breaking candidate history tracking and admin permission checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialPubkeyMap] [Initial Pubkey Collision] If two different pubkeys map to the same initial pubkey in InitialPubkeyMap, could this cause admin permission conflicts where one admin controls multiple candidates? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialToNewestPubkeyMap] [Newest Pubkey Inconsistency] Can InitialToNewestPubkeyMap become desynchronized with CandidateReplacementMap, causing GetNewestPubkey to return incorrect values and misdirect votes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialToNewestPubkeyMap] [Replacement Cycle] If InitialToNewestPubkeyMap contains replacement cycles, could pubkey resolution enter infinite loops, causing DoS when resolving candidate identities? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [States: CandidateReplacementMap, InitialPubkeyMap, InitialToNewestPubkeyMap] [Replacement State Inconsistency] Can these three replacement-related mappings become inconsistent with each other, causing different pubkey resolution results depending on which map is queried first? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: EmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress] [Emergency Address Takeover] Can EmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress be changed to an attacker's address, granting them emergency powers to ban candidates, update candidate information, or remove nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: EmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress] [Emergency Address Not Set] If EmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress is null or not initialized, can emergency response operations be blocked entirely, preventing response to actual malicious candidates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: EmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress] [Emergency Powers Abuse] Does EmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress have sufficient limitations to prevent abuse of emergency powers like arbitrary candidate removal without proper evidence? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateSponsorMap] [Sponsor Theft] Can CandidateSponsorMap be manipulated so that when a candidate quits, their locked tokens are sent to an attacker's address instead of the legitimate sponsor? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateSponsorMap] [Sponsor Overwrite] When a candidate is replaced via ReplaceCandidatePubkey, is the sponsor mapping properly transferred, or could this allow sponsor funds to be lost or misdirected? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CandidateSponsorMap] [Missing Sponsor] If CandidateSponsorMap has no entry for a candidate, where do quit election tokens go, and can this cause funds to be locked in the contract permanently? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: ElectionEnabled] [Election Disable DoS] Can ElectionEnabled flag be set to false by an attacker, completely disabling all election operations and freezing the consensus system? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: ElectionEnabled] [Election Toggle Race] If ElectionEnabled can be toggled rapidly, could this cause race conditions where votes are cast while elections are disabled, creating orphaned or invalid votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: WeightsAlreadyFixedMap] [Weight Fix Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate WeightsAlreadyFixedMap to mark votes as already fixed when they're not, preventing proper profit detail removal on withdrawal? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: WeightsAlreadyFixedMap] [Duplicate Weight Removal] If WeightsAlreadyFixedMap is not properly set, could the same profit beneficiary be removed multiple times during withdrawal, causing accounting errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: WeightsAlreadyFixedMap] [Weight Fix Memory Leak] Does WeightsAlreadyFixedMap get properly cleaned up after withdrawals, or do entries accumulate infinitely causing storage bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [States: ElectorVotes, CandidateVotes] [Vote Amount Mismatch] Can the sum of ElectorVotes.ActiveVotedVotesAmount across all voters differ from the sum of CandidateVotes.ObtainedActiveVotedVotesAmount across all candidates, indicating vote double-counting or loss? (High)"
