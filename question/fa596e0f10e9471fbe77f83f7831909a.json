  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [Gas Exhaustion via Collisions] As State.IsCreatedMap fills, the probability of needing multiple do-while iterations increases - can this be weaponized to make NFT creation prohibitively expensive for later users? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Gas Cost of Multiplication Loop] The loop 'for (var i = 1; i < length; i++) protocolNumber = protocolNumber.Mul(10)' executes length times - can extremely large lengths cause excessive gas consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: InitialNFTTypeNameMap()] [Initialization Gas Cost] The function populates multiple state variables in a loop - if called frequently due to null checks, does this waste gas or provide a DOS vector? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: AssertMetadataKeysAreCorrect()] [Validation Loop Gas] The foreach loop over metadataKeys checks each against reservedMetadataKey.Contains() - can large metadata key lists cause transactions to exceed gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [Multiplication Overflow] The calculation 'from.Mul(10)' is used as the upper bound - if 'from' is near Int64.MaxValue, does this overflow and produce incorrect ranges? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Add Overflow] The expression 'State.CurrentSymbolNumberLength.Value.Add(1)' could theoretically overflow if the length is at Int32.MaxValue - are there bounds checks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Flag Doubling Overflow] Computing 'flag.Mul(2)' could overflow if flag is near Int32.MaxValue - does this break the length transition logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [Height Subtraction Underflow] The call uses 'Context.CurrentHeight.Sub(1)' - if CurrentHeight is 0 or 1, does this underflow or provide predictable randomness at genesis? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetSymbol()] [NFT Type Injection] The nftType parameter is used directly in state lookups and string concatenation - are there length limits or character restrictions to prevent injection attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: AssertMetadataKeysAreCorrect()] [Enumerable Null Check] If metadataKeys is null, does the foreach loop throw an exception or is there explicit null handling? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetSymbol()] [Empty NFT Type] If nftType is an empty string, does the lookup in State.NFTTypeShortNameMap fail gracefully or produce malformed symbols? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [External Call Reentrancy] The call to State.RandomNumberProviderContract.GetRandomBytes.Call() is external - can a malicious random number provider reenter and manipulate State.IsCreatedMap before randomNumber is marked as created? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: MakeSureTokenContractAddressSet()] [Contract Lookup Reentrancy] Context.GetContractAddressByName() is a system call - can it be exploited to reenter and set State.TokenContract.Value to a malicious address? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: MakeSureRandomNumberProviderContractAddressSet()] [Initialization Reentrancy] Similar to token contract, can GetContractAddressByName() be exploited during random number provider initialization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetSymbol()] [Symbol Format Collision] The symbol format is 'shortName + randomNumber' - can different NFT types with different short names produce colliding symbols if randomNumbers overlap? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [Cross-Range Collisions] When symbol number length increases in GetCurrentNumberLength(), can new range symbols collide with symbols from the previous range? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetSymbol()] [Global vs Type-Specific Uniqueness] State.IsCreatedMap tracks all generated numbers globally - should uniqueness be enforced per NFT type instead, or does global tracking create unnecessary constraints? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: MakeSureTokenContractAddressSet()] [Invalid Address Check] If Context.GetContractAddressByName() returns an invalid or zero address, is there validation before storing in State.TokenContract.Value? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: MakeSureRandomNumberProviderContractAddressSet()] [Consensus Contract Validation] Is there verification that the returned address actually implements the random number provider interface before storing? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: InitialNFTTypeNameMap()] [Duplicate Short Names] The hardcoded mappings add short names like 'XX', 'AR', etc. - are there checks preventing duplicate short names from being assigned to different NFT types? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: InitialNFTTypeNameMap()] [Mapping Synchronization] The function updates both State.NFTTypeShortNameMap and State.NFTTypeFullNameMap - if one update succeeds but the other fails, does this create inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [First Symbol Generation] On the very first symbol generation when State.IsCreatedMap is empty, are there any edge cases in the random number generation or range calculation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Maximum Length] Is there a maximum symbol number length to prevent State.CurrentSymbolNumberLength.Value from growing unbounded? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetSymbol()] [All Types Exhausted] If all NFT types defined in InitialNFTTypeNameMap() have exhausted their symbol number ranges, does symbol generation fail gracefully or enter an invalid state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: AssertMetadataKeysAreCorrect()] [Reserved Keys Undefined] The function calls GetNftMetadataReservedKeys() which is not defined in this file - if this function is not implemented or returns null, does validation fail open or closed? (High)"
