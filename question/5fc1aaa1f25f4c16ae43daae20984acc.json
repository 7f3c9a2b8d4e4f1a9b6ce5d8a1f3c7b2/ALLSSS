  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ChangeOrganizationProposerWhiteList()] [Logic Error] Does the check at line 167-169 prevent removing all proposers if ParliamentMemberProposingAllowed is true, or can both conditions be false simultaneously, locking the organization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ChangeOrganizationProposerWhiteList()] [State Manipulation] Can the whitelist be changed while proposals from removed proposers are still pending, invalidating those proposals retroactively? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ClearProposal()] [Logic Error] Does ClearProposal check if the proposal has already reached release threshold before clearing, or can valuable approved proposals be cleared simply due to expiration? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ClearProposal()] [State Inconsistency] After clearing, are all votes and event logs properly cleaned up, or can historical data lead to state bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ApproveMultiProposals()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a non-current-miner bypass the AssertCurrentMiner check at line 190 by calling during a miner list transition window? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ApproveMultiProposals()] [Logic Error] Does the continue statement at line 195 allow silent failure for invalid proposals, making it impossible to detect malicious proposal IDs in the batch? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: CreateEmergencyResponseOrganization()] [Logic Error] Are the hardcoded emergency thresholds (9000 approval, 1000 abstention/rejection) appropriate for all parliament sizes, or can they be impossible to reach? (High)",
