  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Class: CommandStrategyBase] [Abstract] Can abstract class be instantiated via reflection or unsafe code, bypassing proper subclass initialization? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Fields: Protected] [Encapsulation] Can subclasses improperly modify protected CurrentRound, Pubkey, or CurrentBlockTime fields if they're not properly read-only? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Method: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Virtual] Can malicious subclass override GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand to return malicious ConsensusCommand without proper validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Property: DefaultBlockMiningLimit] [Precision Loss] Can the 3/5 ratio calculation lose significant precision for small MiningInterval values, causing mining limits to be too restrictive? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Property: TinyBlockSlotInterval] [Precision Loss] Can division by 8 lose precision causing TinyBlockSlotInterval to be smaller than intended, making tiny blocks too frequent? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Property: LastTinyBlockMiningLimit] [Precision Loss] Can division by 2 in LastTinyBlockMiningLimit calculation accumulate with TinyBlockSlotInterval division errors causing incorrect final limit? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Comment Line 15-16] [Documentation] Does comment claim of '8 blocks during every time slot' match actual TinyBlocksCount = 8 enforcement in block production code? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Comment Line 57-59] [Documentation] Comment claims LastBlockOfCurrentTermMiningLimit is '8 times DefaultBlockMiningLimit' - is this mathematically accurate or is the comment misleading?
