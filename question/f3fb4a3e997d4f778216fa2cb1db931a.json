  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker create a voting item with exactly 64 options, then repeatedly call AddOption to trigger assertion failures and DOS the voting item from accepting new options, preventing legitimate governance expansion? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the MaximumOptionsCount value of 64 allow an attacker to create voting items with maximum options repeatedly, causing excessive storage consumption and state bloat across multiple voting items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Business Logic] Is the comparison in AddOption using '<' instead of '<=' allowing exactly 64 options when MaximumOptionsCount is 64, or does off-by-one error permit 65 options before rejection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Inconsistent Validation] Does AddOptions check total count after adding all options, allowing temporary bypass of MaximumOptionsCount limit during batch operation before final validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Gas Limit] Can MaximumOptionsCount of 64 options cause gas exhaustion when iterating through all options during voting result calculations or option validation loops? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Initial Registration] Does Register function validate initial options count against MaximumOptionsCount, or can initial registration bypass this limit that only applies to AddOption/AddOptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Storage Cost] Does creating voting items with 64 options each impose unreasonable storage costs on sponsors, potentially enabling economic DOS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Integer Type] Is int type appropriate for MaximumOptionsCount, or should it be byte/ushort to prevent potential type confusion or excessive values if constant is modified? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Magic Number] Does hardcoding 64 as MaximumOptionsCount prevent governance from adjusting this limit for different voting scenarios, potentially limiting system flexibility? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumOptionsCount] [Boundary Validation] Are there race conditions where multiple AddOption calls can bypass MaximumOptionsCount check if options.Count is read before update completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Storage Attack] Can an attacker create voting items with all 64 options at exactly 1024 bytes each, causing 64KB storage per voting item and enabling state bloat attacks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [String Encoding] Does OptionLengthLimit of 1024 measure bytes or characters, potentially allowing multibyte UTF-8 strings to exceed intended storage limits? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Comparison Type] Is the comparison 'option.Length <= OptionLengthLimit' checking string.Length (character count) or byte length, creating encoding-dependent vulnerability? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Gas Consumption] Can submitting options with exactly 1024 characters repeatedly in Vote operations cause excessive gas consumption during string comparison and storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Validation Bypass] Does Register function validate option lengths against OptionLengthLimit during initial registration, or only AddOption/Vote operations check this limit? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [DOS Vector] Can an attacker vote with option strings exactly at 1024 byte limit repeatedly, causing excessive transaction processing time and network congestion? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Special Characters] Does OptionLengthLimit check occur before or after special character validation, potentially allowing malicious payloads up to 1024 bytes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Null Terminator] Can null bytes or other control characters within 1024-length limit bypass validation or cause parsing issues in option storage? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Inconsistent Usage] Is OptionLengthLimit checked in RemoveOption unnecessarily, wasting gas on operations that don't add new data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constant: OptionLengthLimit] [Boundary Case] Does exactly 1024 characters pass validation or fail, indicating off-by-one error in length comparison operators? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constants: MaximumOptionsCount + OptionLengthLimit] [Maximum Attack] Can attacker combine both limits (64 options × 1024 bytes) to create 65,536-byte voting items repeatedly, exhausting contract storage? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Both] [Gas Exhaustion] Does iterating through 64 options of 1024 characters each during voting result aggregation cause transaction gas limits to be exceeded? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Both] [Economic Attack] What is the cost to create maximum-size voting items (64 × 1024 bytes), and can attackers economically DOS the system with repeated maximum-size registrations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Modifier: public const] [Immutability] Are these constants truly immutable, or could contract upgrades modify MaximumOptionsCount and OptionLengthLimit values, breaking existing voting items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Modifier: public] [Information Disclosure] Does public accessibility of constants leak intended system limits to attackers planning resource exhaustion attacks? (Low)"
