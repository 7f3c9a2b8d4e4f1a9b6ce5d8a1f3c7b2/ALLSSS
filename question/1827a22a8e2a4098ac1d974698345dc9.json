  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Missing Authorization Check] Is there any validation that the caller of GetTinyBlockRound() is authorized to retrieve tiny block round information for the specified pubkey? Can unauthorized parties call this to extract sensitive consensus data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Pubkey Enumeration Attack] Can an attacker systematically call GetTinyBlockRound() with all possible pubkeys to enumerate the complete set of active miners and their production statistics, violating privacy assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Minimal State Copying] GetTinyBlockRound() only copies 4 fields (Pubkey, ActualMiningTimes, ProducedBlocks, ProducedTinyBlocks, ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight) at lines 69-73. Can this minimal state be exploited to create rounds that pass initial validation but fail later checks, causing consensus disruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Empty Miner Objects] At line 79, empty MinerInRound objects are added for all other miners. Can these empty objects cause null reference exceptions or validation failures when the round is processed by consensus logic expecting complete miner data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [ActualMiningTimes Manipulation] ActualMiningTimes is copied at line 70. For tiny blocks, if timing constraints are relaxed, can a malicious miner set arbitrary ActualMiningTimes values to produce tiny blocks outside their assigned slots, disrupting consensus ordering? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [ProducedTinyBlocks Counter Abuse] ProducedTinyBlocks is copied at line 72. Is there a maximum limit on tiny blocks per round? Can a miner exploit unlimited tiny block production to spam the network or claim excessive rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight Inconsistency] At line 73, ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight is copied for tiny block rounds. Can inconsistent LIB heights between regular and tiny block rounds create chain reorganization vulnerabilities or finality breaks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [RoundId Validation Gap] RoundIdForValidation is set at line 64, but there's no validation that the RoundId is legitimate. Can an attacker create tiny block rounds with forged RoundIds that bypass cross-validation with the main chain? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Except() Logic Flaw] At line 78, Except() is used to exclude the target pubkey. If RealTimeMinersInformation.Keys contains duplicates or the pubkey appears multiple times, can this logic fail to properly exclude it, causing duplicate entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Empty MinerInRound Default Values] New MinerInRound() objects at line 79 will have default values for all fields. Can these defaults (likely zeros/nulls) be interpreted as valid data by downstream consensus logic, allowing ghost miners or fake participation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Missing Field Initialization] For non-target miners, are empty MinerInRound objects sufficient, or should fields like Order and IsExtraBlockProducer be initialized? Can missing these fields break ordering logic or privilege checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Incomplete Round Structure] The returned Round object has complete data only for one miner and empty objects for others. Is this intended design, or can it lead to validation errors when the round is used for block production or verification? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound() vs GetTinyBlockRound()] [Inconsistent State Representation] GetUpdateValueRound() creates partial miner data for non-target miners while GetTinyBlockRound() creates empty objects. Can this inconsistency cause issues if both round types are processed by the same validation logic, leading to bypasses? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound() vs GetTinyBlockRound()] [Different Field Coverage] GetUpdateValueRound() includes OutValue, Signature, and PreviousInValue while GetTinyBlockRound() omits them. Can an attacker exploit tiny block rounds to bypass secret sharing or signature validation checks that regular rounds must pass? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: Both Methods] [RoundNumber Consistency] Both methods copy RoundNumber directly. Is there validation that RoundNumber increments correctly and can't be set to arbitrary values? Can round number manipulation cause consensus forks or allow replaying old rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: Both Methods] [Return Value Validation] Neither method validates the returned Round object before returning. Can downstream code safely assume the Round is valid, or can malformed rounds cause crashes or exploits in consensus processing? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [No Immutability Check] The source Round object's fields are copied but not marked as read-only. Can the source RealTimeMinersInformation be modified during the copy operation, causing race conditions or inconsistent round states? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Missing Deep Copy] Collections like ActualMiningTimes are copied, but is it a shallow or deep copy? Can modifications to the original collection affect the new round, breaking isolation between rounds? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: Both Methods] [No Rate Limiting] If these methods are publicly callable, is there rate limiting? Can an attacker spam calls to cause resource exhaustion through repeated dictionary operations and object allocations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: Both Methods] [No Audit Logging] Neither method logs execution or pubkey access. Can malicious access to miner information go undetected, preventing forensic analysis after an attack? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [No Object Size Limit] The loop at line 35 processes all miners in RealTimeMinersInformation. If the miner count is unbounded, can an extremely large miner set cause out-of-memory errors or timeout the transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [No Tiny Block Limit Validation] The method doesn't check if the miner has already produced maximum allowed tiny blocks. Can unlimited tiny block production exhaust network resources or enable spam attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Null Reference in MinerInRound] If minerInRound.ActualMiningTimes, minerInRound.OutValue, or other fields are null, will accessing them cause NullReferenceException at lines 23-29? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Null PreviousInValue] If minerInRound.PreviousInValue or information.Value.PreviousInValue is null at lines 27 or 51, can this break cryptographic chains or cause null pointer dereferencing in subsequent operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: Both Methods] [RealTimeMinersInformation Null Check] Is RealTimeMinersInformation itself validated to be non-null before access? Can a corrupted state where this field is null cause critical failures? (High)"
