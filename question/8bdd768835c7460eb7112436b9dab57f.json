  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Dependency: Round.GetMiningOrder] Order property at line 36 calls Round.GetMiningOrder() which may return int.MaxValue for invalid miner. Can int.MaxValue order value cause arithmetic overflow in derived classes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Dependency: Round.GetMiningInterval] MiningInterval property at line 37 depends on Round.GetMiningInterval() which can return 0 or negative for invalid round data. Can this propagate to all mining limit calculations causing consensus halt? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Edge Case: Small MiningInterval] If MiningInterval < 8, TinyBlockSlotInterval at line 42 becomes 0, making all mining limit calculations return 0. Can this completely prevent block production? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Edge Case: Large MiningInterval] If MiningInterval is very large (e.g., 1 hour), can this cause excessively long time slots allowing malicious miners to delay consensus progress significantly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Edge Case: MiningInterval=1] If MiningInterval=1ms, TinyBlockSlotInterval=0, DefaultBlockMiningLimit=0, LastTinyBlockMiningLimit=0. Can this edge case make consensus completely non-functional? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Edge Case: Single Miner] MinersCount=1 is valid case but consensus assumptions may require multiple miners for security. Can single miner scenario bypass Byzantine fault tolerance requirements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Access: Protected Fields] CurrentRound, Pubkey, CurrentBlockTime are protected at lines 24-26. Can derived classes modify these in unsafe ways since C# readonly only prevents reassignment, not mutation of referenced objects? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Access: Protected Properties] All calculation properties are protected allowing derived class access but no external access. Can malicious derived class expose these for unauthorized access? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Access: Public Methods] GetConsensusCommand() at line 62 is public allowing external calls. Can external caller trigger command generation at inappropriate times causing consensus disruption? (Medium)"
