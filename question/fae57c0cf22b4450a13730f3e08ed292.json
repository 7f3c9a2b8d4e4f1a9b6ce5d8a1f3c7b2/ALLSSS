  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker craft a malicious scheme input that generates a hash collision with an existing scheme ID in SchemeInfos mapping, allowing them to overwrite an existing scheme's configuration and steal profits? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [State Validation] Can CreateScheme() write a null or partially initialized Scheme object to SchemeInfos[schemeId], breaking invariants for subsequent operations that assume complete scheme data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [Race Condition] Can concurrent calls to CreateScheme() and AddBeneficiary() cause a race condition where SchemeInfos[schemeId] is read as null after scheme creation but before state commit, allowing duplicate scheme creation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [Integer Overflow] Can TotalShares field in SchemeInfos[schemeId] overflow when AddBeneficiary() repeatedly adds beneficiaries with maximum shares, corrupting profit distribution calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [State Poisoning] Can an attacker create a scheme with extreme values (e.g., CurrentPeriod = long.MaxValue) in SchemeInfos that causes DistributeProfits() to fail for all subsequent periods? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [Token Symbol DOS] Can an attacker add unlimited token symbols to SchemeInfos[schemeId].ReceivedTokenSymbols, causing DistributeProfits() to run out of gas iterating through symbols? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractState.cs] [State: SchemeInfos] [State Rollback] If DistributeProfits() partially updates SchemeInfos[schemeId].CurrentPeriod but fails mid-execution, can beneficiaries claim profits twice from the same period? (Critical)",
