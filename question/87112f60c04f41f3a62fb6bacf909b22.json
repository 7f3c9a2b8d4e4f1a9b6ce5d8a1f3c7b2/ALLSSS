  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker frontrun the RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() initialization to set themselves as the controller before legitimate governance takes control, enabling unauthorized fee manipulation for all contract methods? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Authorization Bypass] If State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress is not set (null/empty) after RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet(), can any sender bypass the authorization check at line 18 and set arbitrary method fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker create a malicious token contract that reenters SetMethodFee during the AssertValidFeeToken check at line 15, modifying State.TransactionFees before the legitimate write at line 20? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [State Corruption] Does the function validate that input.MethodName is not null/empty before using it as a state key at line 20, or can an attacker corrupt the state mapping with invalid keys? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker set negative BasicFee values in input.Fees to bypass fee charges, since AssertValidFeeToken at line 15 only validates symbol and amount but may not check for negative amounts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker set method fees with thousands of different token symbols in input.Fees, causing the foreach loop at line 15 to consume excessive gas and DOS the SetMethodFee functionality? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Logic Error] If input.Fees contains duplicate symbols, does the validation loop at line 15 check each duplicate separately, potentially allowing inconsistent fee states or wasted gas? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [State Overwrite] Can an authorized controller overwrite existing method fees without checks, potentially breaking fee collection for critical system methods like Transfer or Approve? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Economic Attack] Can the controller set extremely high method fees for critical operations like Transfer or CrossChainReceiveToken to effectively DOS the token contract and prevent all token movements? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Validation Bypass] Does AssertValidFeeToken at line 15 properly validate that the token exists and is burnable, or can a controller set fees in non-existent tokens that will fail during fee charging? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit the AssertSenderAddressWith check at line 27 if State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress is somehow set to a zero address or attacker-controlled address during initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Validation Bypass] Does CheckOrganizationExist at line 28 make a secure cross-contract call, or can an attacker deploy a malicious contract that returns true for any organization address, bypassing the validation at line 29? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Race Condition] Can an attacker frontrun a legitimate ChangeMethodFeeController call to change the controller to themselves, then immediately call SetMethodFee before the legitimate transaction executes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker pass input.ContractAddress as null or an invalid address, and does CheckOrganizationExist properly handle this case or will it cause a runtime error at line 118? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [State Corruption] Can an attacker set input.OwnerAddress to address(0) or their own address, and will CheckOrganizationExist return false or will it pass validation allowing controller hijacking at line 31? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Cross-Contract Security] Does the Context.Call at line 118 properly validate the return value, or can a malicious contract return a manipulated BoolValue that bypasses organization existence checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Reentrancy] Can CheckOrganizationExist trigger a reentrancy attack through the cross-contract call at line 118-120, allowing state modifications before line 31 executes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Logic Error] If RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet at line 26 initializes a default controller, can this create a time window where State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress changes between lines 26-27, causing authorization bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker query method fees for internal methods not in the hardcoded list at lines 39-44 to discover fee-free attack vectors or undocumented methods?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [DOS Vector] Can an attacker call GetMethodFee with extremely long input.Value strings to cause excessive gas consumption or string comparison overhead in the Contains check at line 44?
