  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Null Reference Vulnerability] If proposerWhiteList parameter is null, does the method throw NullReferenceException when accessing proposerWhiteList.Proposers.Count, allowing DOS of organization validation at creation or whitelist change operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Null Reference Vulnerability] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers collection itself is null (not just empty), does Count() throw exception during Validate() call in CreateOrganization, blocking all organization creation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Null Reference Vulnerability] If proposerWhiteList is null, does Empty() crash when calling Count() extension method, causing DOS in Validate() method that checks organization.ProposerWhiteList.Empty()? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Null Reference Vulnerability] If proposerWhiteList parameter is null, does Contains() throw NullReferenceException during AssertIsAuthorizedProposer check, blocking all proposal creation for legitimate proposers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Null Reference Vulnerability] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers is null, does Contains() throw exception in AssertIsAuthorizedProposer, permanently locking proposal creation for an organization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Null Parameter Handling] If address parameter is null when calling Contains(), does the method fail to properly reject null addresses, potentially allowing unauthorized proposal creation if null is stored in whitelist? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Authorization Bypass] Does Contains() perform case-sensitive address comparison allowing attacker to bypass whitelist check by using different address encoding/formatting while representing the same address? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit Address equality operator implementation to create collision addresses that pass Contains() check without being in the actual whitelist, bypassing proposal authorization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Authorization Bypass] In ChangeOrganizationProposerWhiteList, if Empty() returns false positive (not empty when it should be), does this allow setting invalid whitelist that violates Validate() invariant, breaking proposal authorization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Authorization Bypass] Does Contains() check only first occurrence in Proposers list, allowing duplicate addresses to bypass authorization logic if whitelist modification removes first but not second entry? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Race Condition] If ProposerWhiteList is modified during AssertIsAuthorizedProposer execution, can Contains() check pass for address that gets removed before proposal creation completes, creating unauthorized proposals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [State Consistency] If Proposers list is modified between Empty() call in Validate() and actual organization storage, can organization be created with empty whitelist violating the non-empty invariant? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Race Condition] During ChangeOrganizationProposerWhiteList, if Empty() check passes but whitelist is cleared before Validate() runs, can this create organization with empty whitelist breaking proposal creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Race Condition] Between ValidateProposerInWhiteList view call and actual CreateProposal transaction, if whitelist changes removing proposer, can stale validation result lead to unauthorized proposal creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Validation Bypass] In Validate() method checking organization.ProposerWhiteList.Empty(), if Empty() incorrectly returns false when Count is 0 due to integer overflow, can organizations with zero proposers be created? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Authorization Failure] In AssertIsAuthorizedProposer, if Contains() returns true for addresses not actually in whitelist due to hash collision in underlying collection, can unauthorized users create proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Integer Overflow] If Proposers.Count returns negative value due to collection corruption, does Count() propagate this allowing Empty() to return false, bypassing empty whitelist validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Logic Error] In ValidateProposerInWhiteList view method, if Contains() has different behavior than in AssertIsAuthorizedProposer context, can off-chain validation pass while on-chain proposal creation fails, causing user experience issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [DOS Attack] If Proposers collection can grow unbounded, does Count() iteration become expensive enough to DOS organization validation, preventing organization creation or threshold changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [DOS Attack] If Proposers list contains millions of addresses, does Contains() linear search cause transaction timeout in AssertIsAuthorizedProposer, blocking all proposal creation? (High)",
