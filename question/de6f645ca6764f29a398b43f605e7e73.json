  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Serialization] When RemovedDetails is serialized/deserialized for state persistence, does it maintain the accumulated values correctly, or can deserialization reset values to incorrect states? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Event Ordering] If TryAdd is called out of chronological order (e.g., period 100 before period 50), does this cause issues in profit distribution calculations that assume ordered periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Caller Authorization] Does TryAdd have any access control checks, or can any contract or external caller manipulate removal details, potentially corrupting profit scheme data? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Reentrancy] If TryAdd is called during a profit distribution operation via callback or reentrancy, can this corrupt the removal state mid-calculation and cause incorrect profit allocations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Duplicate Periods] Can the same period key be added multiple times with different values, accumulating amounts that don't reflect actual removal events, inflating removal totals artificially? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Value Consistency] If TryAdd is called with inconsistent values (e.g., first call with weight 100, second with weight 50 for same removal), does the accumulation produce meaningful results or corrupt profit math? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Class: RemovedDetails] [Dictionary Operations] Can usage of Dictionary's TryGetValue, Contains, Keys, Values, or enumeration methods expose internal state in ways that enable attackers to identify and exploit profit distribution vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Min Value] Can passing value = long.MinValue to TryAdd cause issues when accumulated with existing values, potentially causing overflow in the negative direction? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Add() Method] Does the AElf.CSharp.Core.Add() extension method used in this[key].Add(value) have overflow checking enabled, or can it silently wrap on overflow? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Checked Context] Is TryAdd executed in a checked arithmetic context that throws on overflow, or an unchecked context that allows silent wrapping, potentially corrupting accumulated values? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Class: RemovedDetails] [No Removal Method] Since there is no method to remove or correct entries, if incorrect data is added via TryAdd, is it permanently stored, potentially corrupting all future profit calculations for that period? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Class: RemovedDetails] [No Validation Method] Is there any method to validate that accumulated removal amounts are consistent with actual beneficiary removals, or can silent corruption go undetected? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Class: RemovedDetails] [No Query Method] Without a safe query method, must external code access the dictionary directly, potentially exposing it to misuse or allowing bypass of intended access patterns? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [ContainsKey Cost] For large dictionaries, does the ContainsKey check become expensive, and can an attacker exploit this by filling the dictionary to cause TryAdd to consume excessive gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Accumulation Pattern] If the typical usage pattern involves frequent TryAdd calls to the same key, does the ContainsKey + Add pattern create unnecessary overhead compared to direct accumulation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Method Naming] The method is named TryAdd but doesn't return a boolean success indicator like standard Try* patterns—can this naming confusion lead developers to misuse it, assuming it has try-pattern semantics? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Silent Failure] Since TryAdd has void return type, if any operation fails internally (e.g., exception in Add()), can the failure go unnoticed by the caller, leading to silent data corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Class: RemovedDetails] [External Modification] Can other contracts or contract methods directly modify the RemovedDetails instance since it's public, bypassing TryAdd and violating accumulation semantics? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Class: RemovedDetails] [Shared State] If multiple profit schemes share or reference the same RemovedDetails instance, can modifications in one scheme corrupt removal tracking in another? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Transaction Boundaries] If TryAdd is called multiple times within a single transaction that later reverts, are all accumulated values properly rolled back, or can partial state corruption occur? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Profit Distribution Impact] When profit distribution calculations use RemovedDetails, can accumulated values that include overflowed or corrupted amounts cause incorrect profit allocations to remaining beneficiaries? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Weight Calculation] If TryAdd accumulates beneficiary weights that were removed, can manipulation of these accumulated values cause the total scheme weight to become incorrect, breaking profit distribution ratios? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Period Rollover] When a new profit period begins, does the system properly account for accumulated RemovedDetails from previous periods, or can stale removal data corrupt new period calculations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Batch Operations] If TryAdd is called many times in a loop for different keys, can gas costs exceed block limits, causing legitimate removal recording operations to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/Models/RemovedDetails.cs] [Function: TryAdd()] [Key Collision] Are period keys guaranteed to be unique across all profit schemes, or can key collisions occur if multiple schemes use the same RemovedDetails data structure? (Medium)"
