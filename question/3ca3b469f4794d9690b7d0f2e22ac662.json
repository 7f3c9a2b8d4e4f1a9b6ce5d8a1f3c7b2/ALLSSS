(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: CheckOrganizationExist()] [Logic Flaw] Does CheckOrganizationExist validate that authorityInfo.ContractAddress actually implements the AuthorizationContractContainer interface before calling at line 69, or could this cause runtime errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: CheckOrganizationExist()] [Reentrancy] Can the external call to authorityInfo.ContractAddress at line 69 create reentrancy opportunities if the target contract calls back into ElectionContract methods? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Integer Validation] Can the check amount >= 0 at line 76 be bypassed with long.MaxValue or other boundary values that pass the assertion but cause overflow in subsequent fee calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [State Initialization Race] Can an attacker exploit the lazy initialization of State.TokenContract.Value at lines 77-79 by calling AssertValidToken concurrently, causing multiple assignments or race conditions? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Token Validation Bypass] Can State.TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee at line 81 be bypassed if the TokenContract has been upgraded to a malicious version that always returns true?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Input Validation] If symbol parameter is null or empty string, does the IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee call at line 81 handle this correctly or could it return unexpected results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Logic Flaw] Does the assertion at line 81 provide sufficient information about why a token is invalid, or could ambiguous error messages at line 82 hide the root cause (blacklisted vs non-existent vs wrong format)? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Reentrancy] Can the external call to State.TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee at line 81 create reentrancy opportunities if the TokenContract is malicious and calls back into ElectionContract? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Amount Validation] Does the >= 0 check at line 76 properly handle negative values represented in two's complement, or could an attacker pass amount = long.MinValue to bypass the check? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee immediately after ChangeMethodFeeController in the same block, exploiting the fact that both call RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet but with different timing assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] If ChangeMethodFeeController is called with a valid organization that is later disbanded or becomes invalid, can SetMethodFee still be called by the disbanded organization's address, bypassing active organization checks? (High)",

(Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] Can an attacker first call GetMethodFeeController to read the current controller, then use that information to craft a malicious ChangeMethodFeeController call that appears legitimate?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] If AssertValidToken is called for the same symbol multiple times in a single SetMethodFee call (if input.Fees has duplicates), does this cause multiple external calls to TokenContract, wasting gas or creating reentrancy windows? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [MEV/Front-running] Can an attacker observe a pending SetMethodFee transaction with low fees in the mempool and front-run it with their own SetMethodFee call setting high fees to maximize extraction from subsequent method calls?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [MEV/Front-running] Can an attacker front-run a ChangeMethodFeeController transaction to execute SetMethodFee with the old controller before the new controller takes effect, locking in unfavorable fees?

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [MEV] Can an attacker who controls block ordering manipulate the sequence of SetMethodFee calls to repeatedly flip fees between high and low values, causing chaos in fee collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] If SetMethodFee is called with input.Fees containing a MethodFee with BasicFee = 0, does this effectively disable fees for that method, and is this an intended feature or a bypass? (Medium)",
