  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Management] [Immutability] Once State.MethodFeeController.Value is set, there's no reset mechanism - if controller becomes compromised or organization dissolves, is there recovery path or permanent lock? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Management] [Caching Issue] State.ParliamentContract.Value and State.TokenContract.Value are cached but never invalidated - if system upgrades these contracts, cached addresses become stale causing broken integrations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Management] [Data Persistence] State.TransactionFees mapping grows unbounded as new method names are added - can this cause storage exhaustion or increased gas costs over time leading to economic DOS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Trust Model] All external calls (Parliament, Token, Organization contracts) are trusted without validation - can malicious system admin replace these contracts with trojans? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Contract Upgrade] If Parliament or Token contracts are upgraded, does Association contract need redeployment or can it adapt - missing upgrade path could brick fee management? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Error Propagation] External contract failures in RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet(), CheckOrganizationExist(), or AssertValidToken() cause entire transaction revert - can attacker force DOS by making these contracts fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Call Depth] Multiple nested external calls (SetMethodFee -> AssertValidToken -> TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee) could hit call stack limits on some chains causing legitimate operations to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Fee Bypass] After fees are set via SetMethodFee(), there's no enforcement shown in this file - can methods be called without actually paying fees if enforcement is missing in main contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Economic Attack] Fee controller can set BasicFee to 1 (minimum valid) effectively making methods free, undermining economic security model - is there minimum fee threshold validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Centralization] Single OwnerAddress in MethodFeeController has full control over all method fees - is multi-sig or time-lock required or can single key compromise entire fee structure? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Fee Volatility] No rate limiting on SetMethodFee() calls - can controller change fees multiple times per block causing user transactions to fail due to unexpected fee increases? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Token Diversity] Multiple tokens can be set as fees for single method, but is there validation preventing duplicate symbols or conflicts in fee collection logic? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Method Name] SetMethodFee() doesn't validate input.MethodName exists in contract ABI - can attacker set fees for non-existent methods bloating storage or hiding malicious fee configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Collection Size] No limit on input.Fees array size in SetMethodFee() - can attacker submit massive array causing gas exhaustion in AssertValidToken loop or transaction timeout? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [String Injection] symbol parameter in AssertValidToken() passed directly to external call without sanitization - can special characters or escape sequences exploit token contract parsing? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Numeric Overflow] BasicFee is long (int64) type validated only for >= 0, but max value near Int64.MaxValue could cause overflow in fee calculation logic elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Duplicate Detection] No check for duplicate method names across multiple SetMethodFee() calls or duplicate symbols within single input.Fees array causing inconsistent fee state? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Authorization] [Multi-Step] Authorization depends on State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress which references external organization - can organization member changes after controller is set invalidate authorization assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Authorization] [Initialization Window] Between contract deployment and first RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() call, State.MethodFeeController.Value is null - can attacker exploit this window to manipulate state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Authorization] [Controller Switch] When ChangeMethodFeeController() updates controller, old controller loses access instantly without notice period - can this be exploited to lock out legitimate controller during emergency? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Authorization] [Cross-Contract] Authorization relies on Context.Sender which works for direct calls but may break with meta-transactions or delegatecall patterns - is this considered? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Initialization] [First Call Race] RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() can be triggered by multiple functions (SetMethodFee, ChangeMethodFeeController, GetMethodFeeController) - can parallel first calls cause inconsistent initialization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Initialization] [Deployment Order] Contract assumes Parliament contract exists at deployment via Context.GetContractAddressByName - what if Association is deployed before Parliament causing lookup failure? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Initialization] [Default Values] No explicit initialization function - contract relies on lazy initialization which could be triggered by attacker before legitimate admin gets chance? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Gas Exhaustion] SetMethodFee() with large input.Fees array causes multiple external calls to token contract in loop - can this exceed block gas limit preventing legitimate fee updates? (High)"
