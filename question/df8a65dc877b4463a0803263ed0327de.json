  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Authorization Bypass] If ParliamentContract reference is not properly initialized during contract deployment, could an attacker call configuration methods that rely on Parliament authorization checks, bypassing governance controls and enabling unauthorized configuration changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Uninitialized Reference] If ParliamentContract.Value is accessed before initialization in dependent methods, could this cause null reference exceptions that DOS the Configuration contract's critical operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Authorization Bypass] If TokenContract reference is not validated during initialization, could an attacker point it to a malicious token contract implementation that always returns success for authorization checks, bypassing fee payment requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Uninitialized Reference] If TokenContract.Value is accessed before proper initialization, could methods attempting to charge fees or validate token balances fail with null reference exceptions, causing DOS? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Class: ConfigurationState] [State Corruption] Since ConfigurationState is a partial class, if other partial class definitions in different files modify ParliamentContract or TokenContract references, could this create race conditions or state inconsistencies during concurrent transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Contract Address Validation] If the ParliamentContract address is set to an incorrect or malicious contract address during initialization, could all governance-based configuration changes be routed to an attacker-controlled contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Contract Address Validation] If the TokenContract address points to a non-standard token implementation, could this break fee collection logic or enable infinite token minting for configuration-related fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Immutability] Are these contract references immutable after initialization? If ParliamentContract can be changed post-deployment, could an attacker with sufficient privileges redirect governance to a malicious Parliament implementation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Immutability] If TokenContract reference can be modified after deployment, could this enable an attacker to switch to a malicious token contract mid-operation, stealing fees or bypassing payment requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Properties: ParliamentContract, TokenContract] [Initialization Order] If there's no guarantee about the initialization order of ParliamentContract vs TokenContract, could methods that require both references fail or behave unexpectedly during the initialization window? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Cross-Contract Reentrancy] When Configuration contract calls ParliamentContract methods, if Parliament calls back into Configuration before the first call completes, could this enable reentrancy attacks that bypass configuration change validations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Cross-Contract Reentrancy] If Configuration calls TokenContract for fee collection and TokenContract has a callback mechanism (like token transfer hooks), could reentrancy enable double-spending of fees or configuration state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Access Control] Since ParliamentContract is marked internal, if other contracts or methods within the same assembly can access this reference directly, could they bypass intended access controls and make unauthorized Parliament contract calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Access Control] Since TokenContract is internal, could malicious code within the same assembly directly access TokenContract to mint tokens, transfer tokens, or bypass fee collection logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Class: ConfigurationState] [Namespace Pollution] Since the class uses 'using AElf.Contracts.MultiToken' and 'using AElf.Contracts.Parliament', could namespace conflicts or type confusion enable calling wrong contract methods if similarly named types exist? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Version Mismatch] If ParliamentContract reference points to an outdated Parliament contract version with known vulnerabilities, could Configuration contract operations be exploited through the outdated Parliament implementation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Version Mismatch] If TokenContract points to an incompatible MultiToken contract version, could this cause fee collection failures, incorrect balance checks, or token operation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Trust Assumption] Does the Configuration contract blindly trust return values from ParliamentContract without validation? Could a compromised or upgraded Parliament contract return malicious data that corrupts Configuration state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Trust Assumption] If Configuration contract trusts TokenContract balance and allowance data without validation, could a malicious token contract report false balances to bypass payment requirements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Properties: ParliamentContract, TokenContract] [Gas Exhaustion] If these contract references are called in loops or recursive patterns in other Configuration contract methods, could excessive cross-contract calls lead to gas exhaustion DOS attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Proposal Validation] If Configuration relies on ParliamentContract for proposal validation but doesn't verify proposal outcomes, could an attacker create malicious proposals that appear valid but execute unauthorized configuration changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Fee Validation] If Configuration uses TokenContract for fee collection but doesn't verify actual token transfers occurred, could attackers fake fee payments by exploiting return value manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Class: ConfigurationState] [Partial Class Security] Since this is a partial class, if sensitive initialization logic is split across multiple files, could this create security gaps where one partial definition assumes initialization done by another that never executes? (Medium)"
