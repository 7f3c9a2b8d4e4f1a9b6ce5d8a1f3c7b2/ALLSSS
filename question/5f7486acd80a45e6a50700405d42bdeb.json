  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [State Mutation] The function modifies snapshot.ElectionResult by removing invalid/banned candidates - if this snapshot is cached or shared, can it cause inconsistent reads across different callers? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [Logic Error] GetNewestPubkey(bannedCandidate) could return another banned pubkey - is there validation to prevent infinite replacement chains or circular bans? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [Duplicate Key] When adding newestPubkey to snapshot.ElectionResult, the code checks ContainsKey but what if newestPubkey is already in ElectionResult with a different vote count? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [DOS Attack] If bannedCandidates list is very large, the foreach loop with GetNewestPubkey lookups could consume excessive gas - is there a limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [Logic Error] The code removes bannedCandidate AFTER adding newestPubkey - if they're the same due to logic error, can this create phantom entries? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [Race Condition] Between checking IsPubkeyBanned and GetNewestPubkey, the ban status could change - can this lead to inconsistent snapshot data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVote(StringValue)] [Input Validation] The Assert checks value != null && value.Length > 1, but what about value.Length == 1 or very long strings - can these bypass validation and cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVote(string)] [Address Conversion] If AddressHelper.VerifyFormattedAddress(value) is false, it tries to convert from pubkey - can an attacker provide malformed hex causing ByteArrayHelper.HexStringToByteArray to throw? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVote(string)] [Logic Error] The fallback to converting pubkey to address only happens if voterVotes == null AND address format is invalid - can this miss valid lookups if the order of operations is wrong? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVote(string)] [Null Reference] If Address.FromPublicKey throws on invalid pubkey bytes, this could DOS the entire function - is there try-catch protection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithRecords()] [Index Out of Bounds] The code assumes votes.ActiveVotingRecordIds.Count matches votedRecords.Count - if State.VoteContract returns fewer records, can index++ cause out of bounds access? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithRecords()] [DOS Attack] If ActiveVotingRecordIds contains thousands of IDs, the GetVotingRecords call and foreach loop could exhaust gas - is there a maximum record limit? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithRecords()] [Trust Assumption] The function trusts State.VoteContract.GetVotingRecords to return records in the same order as requested IDs - can order mismatches cause vote attribution errors? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithRecords()] [Null Check] The function checks if votes.Address == null && votes.Pubkey == null before returning early - but what if only one is null? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithAllRecords()] [Index Out of Bounds] Similar to GetElectorVoteWithRecords, the index++ pattern with WithdrawnVotingRecordIds could mismatch if State.VoteContract returns unexpected record counts - is this validated? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithAllRecords()] [DOS Attack] Combined active + withdrawn records could create extremely large response data - is there protection against response size DOS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithAllRecords()] [Logic Error] If WithdrawnVotingRecordIds.Any() is false, it returns without checking active records - can this skip important validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotersCount()] [Trust Assumption] Directly returns State.VoteContract.GetLatestVotingResult().VotersCount without validation - can a compromised Vote contract return inflated numbers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotersCount()] [Data Consistency] If State.MinerElectionVotingItemId.Value is stale or incorrect, could this return vote counts from the wrong voting item? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotesAmount()] [Trust Assumption] Similar to GetVotersCount, trusts external Vote contract for VotesAmount - can this be manipulated to show false voting activity? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotesAmount()] [Integer Overflow] If VotesAmount from Vote contract is near Int64.MaxValue, can subsequent calculations overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [DOS Attack] If input.Start is 0 and input.Length is Int32.MaxValue, Math.Min(input.Length, 20) limits to 20, but can repeated calls with different Start values DOS the contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [Logic Error] The triple Math.Min with candidates.Value.Count.Sub(input.Start) - if Count < Start due to concurrent modifications, can Sub() underflow? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [Integer Overflow] If input.Start + length exceeds Int32.MaxValue, can the Skip().Take() operations fail silently or skip wrong candidates? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [Null Reference] If State.CandidateInformationMap[candidate.ToHex()] returns null, it's still added to output - can this cause issues in consuming contracts? (Medium)"
