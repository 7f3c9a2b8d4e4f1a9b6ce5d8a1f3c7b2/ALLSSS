  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Initialization Order] Can the order of initialization between State.ParliamentContract.Value (line 54), State.TokenContract.Value (line 82), and State.MethodFeeController.Value (line 63) create vulnerabilities if some contracts are deployed/initialized in unexpected order? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Cross-Contract Consistency] If TokenContract or ParliamentContract are upgraded/replaced while TokenHolderContract is running, do the cached addresses in State remain valid or can stale contract references cause authorization or validation failures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee & AssertValidToken] [Validation Timing] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee with a valid token that becomes invalid (non-burnable) immediately after AssertValidToken checks it but before State.TransactionFees is updated, causing fees to be set for uncollectable tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ChangeMethodFeeController & CheckOrganizationExist] [Organization Deletion] Can an attacker pass CheckOrganizationExist validation and immediately delete/deactivate the organization in the authorization contract after ChangeMethodFeeController completes, leaving TokenHolderContract with an invalid controller? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [All Functions] [Event Emission] Does the contract emit events after critical state changes (SetMethodFee at line 17, ChangeMethodFeeController at line 29), or can state modifications occur silently making it impossible to audit fee changes and controller transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [All Functions] [Upgrade Path] If this contract needs to be upgraded, can existing fee configurations in State.TransactionFees and State.MethodFeeController be migrated safely, or would an upgrade reset all fee settings causing governance disruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Fee Manipulation] Can the authorized controller set different fees for the same method multiple times in rapid succession to front-run user transactions, causing users to pay unexpected fee amounts when their transactions execute? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Economic Attack] Can an attacker who gains controller access set astronomically high fees for all methods, effectively DOS'ing the entire TokenHolder contract by making all operations prohibitively expensive? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Selective DOS] Can the controller maliciously set zero fees for administrative methods but high fees for user-facing methods, creating an unfair advantage where governance can operate freely while blocking regular users? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Multi-Token Confusion] Can an attacker set fees using multiple different tokens in the same MethodFees input, and does the contract properly handle multi-token fee collection, or can this cause confusion in which token is actually charged? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Fee Bypass] Can an attacker set fees for a method name that differs only in casing or whitespace from the actual method name, creating fee configurations that never get applied due to case-sensitive matching? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee & GetMethodFee] [State Synchronization] If SetMethodFee updates State.TransactionFees[input.MethodName] but a concurrent GetMethodFee call reads the same key, can stale or partially-updated fee data be returned to callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet] [Contract Name Spoofing] Can an attacker register a malicious contract with the name SmartContractConstants.ParliamentContractSystemName before legitimate deployment, causing Context.GetContractAddressByName to return a malicious address that gains controller access? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [CheckOrganizationExist] [Malicious Contract] Can an attacker provide an authorityInfo.ContractAddress that implements ValidateOrganizationExist but returns true for any organization address, allowing them to use fake organizations to take over controller? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [AssertValidToken] [Token Contract Exploit] If the TokenContract address at line 82-83 is compromised or returns to a malicious implementation, can an attacker get non-burnable or non-existent tokens approved for method fees, causing fee collection to fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [All Cross-Contract Calls] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker cause excessive gas consumption by providing inputs that trigger expensive cross-contract calls (CheckOrganizationExist, IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee), making legitimate governance operations unaffordable? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [All Cross-Contract Calls] [Call Failure Handling] Do Context.Call invocations at lines 59, 73-75, and 85 properly handle failures, or can cross-contract call failures leave the contract in inconsistent states with partial updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Null Input] Does SetMethodFee validate that input is not null before accessing input.Fees and input.MethodName, or can a null input cause null reference exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Empty Method Name] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee with an empty string for input.MethodName, creating a default fee configuration that might be unintentionally applied to methods without explicit fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [SetMethodFee] [Large Fee Array] Can an attacker provide an extremely large input.Fees array causing the foreach loop at line 13 to consume excessive gas and potentially causing out-of-gas failures for legitimate fee updates? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ChangeMethodFeeController] [Null Authority Info] Does ChangeMethodFeeController validate that input is not null and that input.OwnerAddress and input.ContractAddress are not null before proceeding with validation at line 26? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ChangeMethodFeeController] [Self-Reference] Can an attacker set input.OwnerAddress to the TokenHolderContract's own address, creating a circular authorization dependency where the contract must authorize itself to change its own controller? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [GetMethodFee] [Null StringValue] Does GetMethodFee handle the case where input or input.Value is null, or can this cause exceptions when accessing State.TransactionFees at line 37? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [AssertValidToken] [Maximum Amount] Does AssertValidToken properly handle the case where amount equals long.MaxValue, ensuring no overflow occurs in subsequent fee calculations that might multiply or add to this amount? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [AssertValidToken] [Special Characters] Can an attacker provide symbol strings with special characters, unicode, or extremely long lengths that cause issues in the cross-contract call to IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee? (Low)"
