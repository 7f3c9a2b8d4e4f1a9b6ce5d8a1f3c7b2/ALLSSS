  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ValidationService.cs] [Function: ValidateInformation()] [Thread Safety] If multiple threads call ValidateInformation() concurrently on the same service instance, and providers have shared mutable state, could race conditions cause validation corruption or inconsistent results? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ValidationService.cs] [Function: ValidateInformation()] [Concurrent Modification] If the IEnumerable _headerInformationValidationProviders is backed by a collection that gets modified by another thread during foreach iteration, could this cause Collection Modified Exception and crash validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ValidationService.cs] [Function: ValidateInformation()] [Incomplete Validation] If a new consensus behavior is added (beyond UpdateValue/NextRound/NextTerm/TinyBlock) but no new validator is added to handle it, could this behavior pass validation without proper checks, introducing consensus bugs? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ValidationService.cs] [Function: ValidateInformation()] [Validator Coverage] Since the service blindly executes whatever providers are given, if a critical validator is accidentally removed from the provider list in calling code, could major consensus invariants go unchecked? (Critical)"
