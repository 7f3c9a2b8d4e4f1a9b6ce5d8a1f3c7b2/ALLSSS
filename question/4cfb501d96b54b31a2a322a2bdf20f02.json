  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [State Sync] If organizationMembers_ is modified in one transaction but Count() is cached in another context, could stale counts cause validation failures or incorrect threshold checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [State Sync] If Contains() is called before state changes are committed, does it reflect pending changes, and could this cause membership checks to use outdated data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [State Sync] If Empty() is evaluated on a cached organization object while the actual stored organization has been modified, could this lead to inconsistent validation results? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Boundary Condition] What happens if Count() is called on an OrganizationMemberList with int.MaxValue members - does it correctly return the count or overflow? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Boundary Condition] If organizationMembers_ contains the maximum allowed number of addresses and Contains() is called, could the search operation timeout or run out of gas? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Edge Case] If an organization starts with members, has them all removed (violating invariants), could Empty() correctly identify this state to prevent further operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count(), Empty()] [Invariant] Empty() returns Count() == 0, but could there be states where Count() returns a non-zero value but all members are invalid, making the organization functionally empty? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address), Count()] [Invariant] If Contains() returns true for every member, the sum should equal Count(), but if duplicates exist, could this invariant be violated affecting vote calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count(), Empty()] [Invariant] After RemoveMember succeeds, Count() should decrement by exactly 1 and Empty() should update accordingly - could any conditions cause this invariant to break? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Protobuf Serialization] When organizationMembers_ is deserialized from protobuf, could malformed data cause Count() to return incorrect values or throw exceptions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Protobuf Serialization] If organizationMembers_ contains addresses that were corrupted during serialization/deserialization, could Contains() fail to find valid members or match invalid ones? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Protobuf Defaults] For a newly instantiated OrganizationMemberList via protobuf default initialization, does Empty() correctly return true, or could default field values cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Missing Validation] Contains() doesn't validate that the address parameter is a valid blockchain address - could invalid address formats cause comparison errors or exceptions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Missing Validation] Count() doesn't verify the integrity of organizationMembers_ - could corrupted state cause negative counts or overflow values to be returned? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Missing Validation] Empty() only checks if count is zero but doesn't validate if the organization is in a valid state - could invalid organizations with zero members pass Empty() checks incorrectly? (Low)"
