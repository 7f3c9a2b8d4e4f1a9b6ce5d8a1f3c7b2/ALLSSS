  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ReferendumContract] [Vote Manipulation] If ReferendumContract.Value points to a malicious contract that accepts proposals without proper token-weighted voting, can an attacker bypass the intended democratic control over UserFeeController, allowing fee parameter changes without community approval and potentially setting zero fees to DOS the network? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ConfigurationContract] [Configuration Injection] When ConfigurationContract is queried for UserContractMethodFees using a key format like 'UserContractMethod_contractAddress_methodName', if the ConfigurationContract reference is compromised, can an attacker return arbitrary fee configurations that override legitimate fee settings, either charging excessive fees to DOS user contracts or zero fees to enable spam? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ConsensusContract] [Reward Manipulation] If ConsensusContract reference is used to query current miner lists or distribute consensus rewards, and this reference can be pointed to a fake contract, can an attacker manipulate which addresses receive transaction fees or mining rewards, effectively stealing value from legitimate miners? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: DividendPoolContract] [Dividend Theft] If DividendPoolContract is called to distribute accumulated fees or dividends based on token holdings, and the reference is compromised to point to an attacker's contract, can the attacker intercept dividend distributions, redirect them to their own address, or manipulate distribution ratios to favor specific addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: AssociationContract] [Organization Address Collision] When State.AssociationContract.CalculateOrganizationAddress is called with CreateOrganizationInput to deterministically compute organization addresses for controllers, if the AssociationContract reference is manipulated, can an attacker control the calculated address to collide with an existing organization they control, gaining unauthorized access to fee controllers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ReferendumContract] [Organization Address Collision] When State.ReferendumContract.CalculateOrganizationAddress is used to determine the referendum controller address before creation, if the calculation can be manipulated through a compromised contract reference, can an attacker predict and front-run organization creation to register the calculated address with their own organization parameters first? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: AssociationContract] [Privileged Creation Bypass] When State.AssociationContract.CreateOrganizationBySystemContract.Send is called to create privileged organizations that bypass normal creation restrictions, if the AssociationContract reference points to a non-system contract or is never initialized, can this allow creation of fake controller organizations without proper system contract authority? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ReferendumContract] [Privileged Creation Bypass] When State.ReferendumContract.CreateOrganizationBySystemContract.Send is used to create the referendum controller for user fees with specific proposer whitelists, if the referendum contract reference is compromised, can an attacker create organizations without whitelist restrictions, enabling anyone to propose fee changes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Properties: ParliamentContract, ReferendumContract, AssociationContract] [Hierarchy Bypass] Since UserFeeController creates a three-layer hierarchy (Parliament -> Referendum -> Association), if any of the three contract references (Parliament, Referendum, Association) are manipulated during controller initialization, can an attacker break the intended governance chain and gain control of user fee parameters through a single compromised layer instead of requiring approval at all three levels? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Properties: ParliamentContract, AssociationContract] [Hierarchy Bypass] Since DeveloperFeeController uses a two-layer hierarchy (Parliament -> Developer Association), if the AssociationContract reference used for the Developer organization is different from the one used for the root controller, can this create inconsistent authorization checks that allow bypassing the parliament layer? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: AssociationContract] [Rental Control Theft] When GetDefaultSideChainRentalController uses State.AssociationContract to create an organization with State.SideChainCreator.Value as a member, if the AssociationContract reference is compromised or SideChainCreator is never properly set, can an attacker gain control over side chain rental fees, potentially making side chain creation free or extracting excessive rental payments? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: AssociationContract] [Member Injection] If CreateAssociationControllerForSideChainRental creates an organization with both parliamentAddress and sideChainCreator as members requiring unanimous approval, but the AssociationContract reference is manipulated to allow creation with different member lists, can an attacker create a rental controller they solely control, monopolizing side chain rental revenue? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ConfigurationContract] [Fee Bypass] In GetActualFee method, if State.ConfigurationContract.Value is set incorrectly or not initialized when charging user contract transaction fees, and the method returns null or empty fees, can user contract calls execute without paying fees, enabling spam attacks that consume block space without economic cost? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ConfigurationContract] [Fee Manipulation] If an attacker can manipulate the ConfigurationContract reference to point to their contract before ChargeUserContractTransactionFees is called, can they return artificially low or zero fees for specific contracts/methods, allowing their transactions to bypass fee requirements while other users pay normal fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Registration Control] When GetCrossChainTokenContractRegistrationController uses ParliamentContract to determine who can register cross-chain token contracts, if the ParliamentContract reference is compromised, can an attacker register fake token contracts for other chains, enabling cross-chain token theft or supply manipulation attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [All Properties] [Delegation Bypass] If any contract reference used during fee charging (like ConfigurationContract for GetActualFee) is manipulated when processing transaction fee delegations, can an attacker bypass delegation limits, charge fees to unauthorized delegators, or avoid fee payments entirely by exploiting reference inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Fee Provider Bypass] Since MultiToken implements ACS1 for method fee provision and uses ParliamentContract to determine fee authority, if the ParliamentContract reference is manipulated when SetMethodFee is called, can an attacker bypass fee provider authorization and set arbitrary fees for token operations, either making them free (DOS) or prohibitively expensive (censorship)? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Properties: ParliamentContract, AssociationContract, ReferendumContract] [Existence Bypass] In CheckOrganizationExist method (referenced by ChangeUserFeeController, ChangeDeveloperController, etc.), if the contract references are compromised to always return true for organization existence regardless of actual state, can an attacker set controller AuthorityInfo to point to non-existent or malicious organizations, breaking governance entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Test Environment Bypass] In GetDefaultParliamentController, if parliamentContractAddress is null (test environment), the method returns an empty AuthorityInfo. If this null check can be triggered in production through contract reference manipulation, can governance operations proceed without any authorization checks, allowing anyone to modify fee controllers or blacklists? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Properties: AssociationContract, ReferendumContract] [Lazy Initialization] If GetDefaultDeveloperFeeController or GetDefaultUserFeeController lazily initialize AssociationContract and ReferendumContract references only when needed, can race conditions during concurrent initialization cause references to be set inconsistently across different controller creation calls, leading to mismatched organization addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ReferendumContract] [Threshold Manipulation] When creating referendum controller with MinimalApprovalThreshold = 1 and MinimalVoteThreshold = 1, if the ReferendumContract reference is compromised to ignore these thresholds, can a single token holder approve user fee changes that should require broader community consensus? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: AssociationContract] [Threshold Manipulation] When creating association controllers with MinimalApprovalThreshold = proposers.Count requiring unanimous approval, if the AssociationContract reference points to a contract that doesn't enforce unanimous voting, can partial approvals pass proposals, bypassing the intended multi-sig security for fee and rental controllers? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ReferendumContract] [Whitelist Bypass] When creating referendum organization with ProposerWhiteList containing only parliamentAddress, if the ReferendumContract reference is manipulated, can arbitrary addresses create proposals to change user fees without being whitelisted, undermining the parliament's gatekeeping role? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: AssociationContract] [Whitelist Bypass] When creating association organizations where ProposerWhiteList.Proposers contains specific addresses (e.g., referendumAddress and parliamentAddress), if the AssociationContract reference allows bypassing whitelist checks, can unauthorized addresses propose changes to fee controllers without meeting whitelist requirements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [All Properties] [Circular Dependency] Since Parliament, Association, and Referendum contracts may themselves reference TokenContract for fee payments, if any of these contract references in MultiToken's state create circular dependencies and one contract is uninitialized, can this cause deadlock situations where no contract can complete initialization, permanently breaking the governance system? (High)"
