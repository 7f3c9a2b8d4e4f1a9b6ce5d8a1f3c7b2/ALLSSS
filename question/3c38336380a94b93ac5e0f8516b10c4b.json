  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [ChangeMember Integration] When ChangeMember replaces OldMember with NewMember, does Count() remain unchanged as expected, or could the remove-then-add sequence cause temporary count fluctuations affecting concurrent operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [ChangeMember Integration] Between RemoveMember(OldMember) and AddMember(NewMember) in ChangeMember, if Contains(OldMember) is called, does it return false, and could this window allow voting power manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [ChangeMember Integration] If ChangeMember swaps OldMember with NewMember where NewMember already exists (creating a duplicate), does Contains() find both before AnyDuplicate() validation runs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [ChangeMember Integration] If ChangeMember is called on an organization with only one member, does the intermediate state after Remove but before Add cause Empty() to return true, bypassing validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Vote Counting] In IsProposalRejected, rejectionMemberCount uses Contains() to filter proposal.Rejections - could an attacker add then remove themselves to keep their rejection in proposal.Rejections without being in the current member list? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Vote Counting] In IsProposalAbstained, abstentionMemberCount uses Contains() - if a member abstains then leaves the organization, does their abstention still count, potentially blocking proposal release? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Vote Counting] In CheckEnoughVoteAndApprovals, approvedMemberCount uses Contains() - if members who approved are later removed, could proposals lose approval retroactively even if they were validly approved at vote time? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Vote Counting] Does Contains() usage in vote counting mean that adding a member who previously voted doesn't count their vote, creating scenarios where identical addresses are treated differently based on membership timing? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Vote Counting] In CheckEnoughVoteAndApprovals, MinimalVoteThreshold is compared against total votes, but MinimalApprovalThreshold is compared against Count() - could this mismatch allow proposals to pass with fewer approvals than intended if non-members voted? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Threshold Validation] In Validate(), organizationMemberCount from Count() must be >= MinimalVoteThreshold - could adding duplicate members inflate Count() allowing lower real member counts to pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Threshold Validation] The validation MaximalAbstentionThreshold + MinimalApprovalThreshold <= Count() assumes Count() is accurate - if Count() includes invalid addresses, could this allow impossible threshold configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Threshold Validation] The validation MaximalRejectionThreshold + MinimalApprovalThreshold <= Count() uses Count() - if the member list has null addresses that Count() includes, could thresholds be set incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Threshold Validation] If Empty() returns false but all members are invalid addresses, could Validate() pass allowing organizations with no functional members to pass governance checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Collection State] Does Count() access organizationMembers_.Count directly without defensive copies, and could concurrent modifications to the underlying collection cause race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Collection State] Does Contains() iterate organizationMembers_ directly, and if the collection is modified during iteration, could this throw exceptions or return incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Protobuf Field Access] Since organizationMembers_ is a protobuf repeated field, does Count() access the internal RepeatedField<Address>.Count, and are there edge cases where this differs from the logical member count? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Input Validation] Contains() accepts an Address parameter without null checking - if null is passed, does the underlying Contains() method throw NullReferenceException, causing DOS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Initialization Check] Does Count() verify that organizationMembers_ is initialized before accessing Count, or could calling Count() on a default-initialized OrganizationMemberList throw NullReferenceException? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Initialization Check] Does Empty() handle the case where organizationMembers_ is null vs. an empty collection differently, and could this cause inconsistent validation behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Reentrancy] If Contains() is called from AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember during a callback that modifies the member list, could stale membership results allow unauthorized approvals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Reentrancy] If Count() is called during Validate() which is called from AddMember, and AddMember triggers a callback that removes members, could Count() return an incorrect value? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Reentrancy] If Empty() is checked in Validate() during RemoveMember, and RemoveMember triggers a reentrancy that adds members back, could the validation incorrectly pass/fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Gas Cost] Since Contains() performs O(n) linear search on organizationMembers_, could attackers create organizations with thousands of members making each vote operation prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Gas Cost] Is Count() called multiple times in Validate() for different threshold checks, and could this cause unnecessary repeated access to the collection count? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [DOS Attack] Could an attacker repeatedly call Approve/Reject/Abstain on large organizations to exploit the O(n) Contains() check in AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember, causing gas-based DOS? (Medium)"
