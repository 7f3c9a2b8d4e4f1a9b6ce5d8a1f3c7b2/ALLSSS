  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/MiningTimeArrangingService.cs] [Function: ArrangeNormalBlockMiningTime()] [Missing Validation] Is there validation that currentBlockTime is not null or default Timestamp instance before passing to Max(), preventing undefined comparison behavior?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/MiningTimeArrangingService.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Access Control] Since MiningTimeArrangingService is private static class within AEDPoSContract partial class, can other contract methods in different partial class files access these without proper authorization checks?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/MiningTimeArrangingService.cs] [Multiple Functions] [State Access] Since methods are static, how do they ensure they're reading the latest round state from blockchain storage rather than stale cached round objects?
