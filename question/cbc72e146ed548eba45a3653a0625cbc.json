  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [State] [Initialized Flag] State.Initialized is checked once at line 18 then set at line 38 - could the contract be called between initialization steps? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [State] [TokenContract Reference] State.TokenContract is set once at line 20 and never updated - could this become stale if TokenContract is upgraded? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [State] [Contract References] Multiple contract references (TokenContract, ElectionContract, ProfitContract, etc.) are set during initialization - are these immutable or could they be changed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Token Economics] [Supply Distribution] Native token supply is split between mining rewards (line 30) and issuer - is the remaining supply after mining rewards validated? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Token Economics] [Resource Token Oversupply] Each resource token gets 500M total supply (line 88) and all are issued to TokenConverter - could this flood the market? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Token Economics] [Election Token Concentration] 1B VOTE and 1B SHARE tokens all issued to one contract (line 132) - is this single point of control a security risk? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Token Economics] [Decimals Inconsistency] Native token decimals are configurable (line 59), resource tokens use 8 decimals (line 89), election tokens use 8 decimals (line 122) - could mismatches break conversions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Token Economics] [Burnable Tokens] Native token burnable status is configurable (line 60), but resource and election tokens are always burnable - could selective burning break economic balance? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Context] [Variables Manipulation] Context.Variables.NativeSymbol, GetStringArray, etc. are used throughout - could manipulating these variables before initialization corrupt the entire economic system? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Context] [Self Reference] Context.Self is used as Issuer and Owner for all tokens - could Context.Self be different in different execution contexts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Context] [Contract Name Resolution] GetContractAddressByName is called repeatedly - could contract name collisions or front-running during deployment cause wrong addresses? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [External] [TokenContract Trust] All token operations are delegated to State.TokenContract - if TokenContract has vulnerabilities, does EconomicContract inherit them? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [External] [Cross-Contract Call Failures] Multiple Send operations to external contracts - if any fail silently without reverting, could initialization complete in invalid state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [External] [TokenConverter Dependency] TokenConverter initialization at line 254 happens after tokens are issued to it - could tokens be trapped if initialization fails? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [External] [ElectionContract Trust] Election tokens and voting events depend on ElectionContract - if compromised, could entire voting system be corrupted? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [DOS] [Loop Unbounded] CreateResourceTokens loops over Context.Variables arrays (lines 80-103) - could excessive array length cause out-of-gas errors during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [DOS] [Connector Creation] InitializeTokenConverterContract creates 1 + 2*N connectors where N is resource token count - could large N cause initialization to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [DOS] [Union Operation] The Union at lines 82, 227 merges two arrays - could duplicate-heavy arrays cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [DOS] [Multiple Cross-Contract Calls] InitialEconomicSystem makes 10+ cross-contract calls - could cumulative gas costs exceed block limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Reentrancy] [Token Issue Callbacks] Token.Issue calls at lines 96, 128, 152, 171 could trigger callbacks - could reentering EconomicContract during initialization corrupt state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Reentrancy] [TokenConverter Initialize] TokenConverterContract.Initialize at line 254 could call back to EconomicContract - is State.Initialized checked to prevent reentrancy? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Race Condition] [Concurrent Initialization] Multiple transactions could call InitialEconomicSystem before State.Initialized is set at line 38 - is there protection against this? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Race Condition] [State Setting Order] State variables are set throughout initialization - could partial state updates be visible to concurrent calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Input Validation] [InitialEconomicSystemInput] No validation of input struct fields - could null, negative, or extreme values break initialization? (High)",
