  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainBalance()] [Balance Manipulation] Can an attacker query the balance immediately after deposits but before fee deductions to see inflated balances and time their indexing operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainBalance()] [Integer Overflow] Can extremely large deposit amounts cause the Int64Value to overflow, returning negative or wrapped balances? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainBalance()] [Terminated Chain Balance] Does this function allow querying balances for terminated chains, potentially enabling withdrawal or refund attacks on inactive chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainBalance()] [Balance-Debt Inconsistency] If GetSideChainIndexingFeeDeposit doesn't account for debt from GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt, can the balance appear solvent while the chain owes fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Debt Calculation] Does summing sideChainInfo.ArrearsInfo.Values correctly handle negative arrears values, or can negative debts offset positive ones, hiding total debt? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Integer Overflow] Can summing multiple large arrears values cause Int64 overflow, wrapping debt to negative and showing solvent status for insolvent chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [ArrearsInfo Null] If sideChainInfo.ArrearsInfo is null or Values is empty, does the sum return 0, falsely indicating no debt for chains with uninitialized debt tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Debt Forgiveness Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate ArrearsInfo.Values (if mutable) to reduce debt before querying, allowing continued indexing despite unpaid fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDebt()] [Terminated Chain Debt] Does this function prevent querying debt for terminated chains, or can it return stale debt that should have been cleared during termination? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Serial Number Overflow] If State.SideChainSerialNumber.Value overflows Int64 due to excessive side chain creations, can the for loop iterate incorrectly or skip chains? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Terminated Chain Skipping] Does skipping Terminated chains on line 109-110 hide chains that still have pending cross-chain data or unprocessed transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Chain ID Collision] If GetChainId(i) generates duplicate chain IDs for different serial numbers, can dict.IdHeightDict.Add throw an exception or overwrite heights? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Height Consistency] Can the loop retrieve heights that are stale or not yet indexed, causing downstream operations to use incorrect side chain heights? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Race Condition] During concurrent side chain creation, can the serialNumber be incremented while this function iterates, causing missed or duplicate chains in the output? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [DOS via Large Serial Number] If serialNumber is extremely large (e.g., 10^9), can the for loop cause gas exhaustion or timeout for view function callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIdAndHeight()] [Null SideChainInfo] If State.SideChainInfo[chainId] is null after GetChainId, does the null check on SideChainStatus throw an exception or skip the chain silently? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Parent Chain Height Validation] If GetParentChainHeight().Value returns a height <= GenesisBlockHeight due to rollback or corruption, does the Assert on line 125 properly fail, or can invalid heights be added? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Genesis Block Constant] Is AElfConstants.GenesisBlockHeight correctly defined as 1 or 0, and can off-by-one errors allow height 1 to be considered invalid? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Parent Chain Absence] If ParentChainId is 0, the function returns side chains only without asserting parent chain existence—can this cause confusion for chains that should have parents? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetAllChainsIdAndHeight()] [Height Synchronization] Do the returned side chain and parent chain heights represent a consistent cross-chain snapshot, or can they be from different time points? (Medium)",
