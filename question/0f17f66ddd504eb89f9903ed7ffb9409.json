(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConvert_Views.cs] [Function: GetNeededDeposit()] [State Race Condition] Between lines 62-72 (GetTokenInfo, GetBalance calls) and line 73 calculation, if another transaction changes token supply or contract balance, does this create TOCTOU vulnerability where needDeposit becomes stale before EnableConnector uses it? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConvert_Views.cs] [Function: GetNeededDeposit()] [Related Symbol Validation] At line 60, fromConnector is obtained via toConnector.RelatedSymbol—if RelatedSymbol is empty string or invalid, does State.Connectors return null, triggering assertion at line 61 without proper error context? (Low)",

(Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConvert_Views.cs] [Function: GetDepositConnectorBalance()] [Assertion Logic Error] At line 96, the assertion requires connector != null AND !connector.IsDepositAccount—this means the function only works for resource connectors, not deposit connectors. Is this intentional, and does it break balance queries for deposit account symbols? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConvert_Views.cs] [Function: GetDepositConnectorBalance()] [Symbol Swap] At line 97, ntSymbol is set to connector.RelatedSymbol (the deposit connector symbol)—if this relationship is reversed or corrupted in state, does the function return the wrong connector's balance?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConvert_Views.cs] [Function: GetDepositConnectorBalance()] [Uninitialized State] If State.DepositBalance[ntSymbol] has never been set (returns default 0), but VirtualBalance is non-zero, does the function correctly return VirtualBalance, or does it indicate an inconsistent state?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConvert_Views.cs] [Function: IsSymbolAbleToSell()] [Logic Inconsistency] At line 107, the function checks depositConnector.IsPurchaseEnabled—but shouldn't it check BOTH depositConnector and resourceConnector's IsPurchaseEnabled flags to ensure the full pair is enabled for selling?
