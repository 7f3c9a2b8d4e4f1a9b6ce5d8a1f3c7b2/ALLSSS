  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Time Manipulation] Does CheckProposalNotExpired at line 161 use Context.CurrentBlockTime which can be manipulated by validators within consensus rules? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Validation Bypass] Can a proposal pass validation with an expired time set far in the future (e.g., year 3000), effectively creating permanent proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [DOS Attack] Can ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme at line 163 be exploited with extremely long URLs that pass validation but cause gas issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [Validation Bypass] Can malicious URLs like 'http://attack.com/<script>' pass validation but execute code when displayed in UIs? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [Logic Error] Does the function return true for empty strings at line 171, allowing proposals with no description URL, which might be expected to be mandatory? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [DOS Vector] Can Uri.TryCreate at line 172 consume excessive gas for malformed URIs that are intentionally crafted to be complex? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: CheckProposalNotExpired()] [Time Manipulation] Can proposals with ExpiredTime exactly equal to Context.CurrentBlockTime be considered expired or valid, causing edge-case race conditions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: CheckProposalNotExpired()] [Logic Error] Does the strict inequality at line 179 (CurrentBlockTime < ExpiredTime) mean proposals expire exactly at ExpiredTime, or one block after? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: AssertProposalNotYetVotedByMember()] [Logic Error] Does the assertion message 'Already approved' at line 192 mislead when a member already rejected or abstained, not approved? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: CheckProposalAlreadyVotedBy()] [Vote Manipulation] Can duplicate addresses appear in multiple vote lists (Approvals, Rejections, Abstentions), and does Contains() return true for any match? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: CheckProposalAlreadyVotedBy()] [Performance Issue] For proposals with hundreds of votes, does the triple Contains() check cause O(n) lookups that slow down voting? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: ValidateParliamentMemberAuthority()] [Performance Issue] Does calling GetCurrentMinerList for every authorization check cause excessive Consensus contract calls? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: AssertCurrentMiner()] [Consensus Manipulation] Can IsCurrentMiner check be gamed by attacking during miner rotation windows where miner status is ambiguous? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: AssertCurrentMiner()] [Time-Based Attack] Can miners use their current miner status to approve proposals, then immediately lose miner status but have their approvals still count? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: GenerateProposalId()] [Collision Attack] If input.Token is null, can HashHelper.ComputeFrom(input) produce identical hashes for different inputs, causing proposal ID collisions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament.cs] [Function: GenerateProposalId()] [Logic Error] Can the same proposal parameters be used to generate the same ID across different organizations, or is Context.Self sufficient for uniqueness? (Medium)"
