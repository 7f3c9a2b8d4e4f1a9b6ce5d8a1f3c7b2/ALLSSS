  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: ReclaimVoteToken()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Expired check at line 119 uses CurrentBlockTime. Can timestamp manipulation allow premature token reclaim, invalidating vote quorums? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateProposal()] [Unbounded Loops] If ProposerWhiteList contains many addresses, does the Contains() check at line 204 in AssertIsAuthorizedProposer cause gas issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: Validate() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [External Call DOS] GetTokenInfo at line 95 is an external call. Can a malicious token contract revert or consume excessive gas to DOS organization creation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: LockToken() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [TransferFrom DOS] If token contract reverts TransferFrom at line 47-55, does this prevent all voting? Can an attacker exploit this to freeze governance? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CalculateVirtualHash() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [Hash Collision] At line 221-226, virtual hash is organizationHash if creationToken is null, else concatenated hash. Can attackers create hash collisions to control multiple organization virtual addresses? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: GenerateProposalId() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [Proposal ID Prediction] At line 156, proposal ID is generated from input.Token or input hash. Can attackers predict proposal IDs to pre-create conflicting proposals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CalculateOrganizationHashAddressPair() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [Deterministic Addresses] Organization address is deterministically calculated from input at lines 210-218. Can attackers create organizations at predetermined addresses to exploit virtual address schemes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateProposal()] [Method Name Validation] ContractMethodName at line 107 only checks for non-whitespace. Can attackers call internal/private methods or non-existent methods to cause execution failures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateProposal()] [ToAddress Validation] ToAddress at line 106 only checks for null. Can attackers set ToAddress to Referendum contract itself or other system contracts to execute privileged operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateProposal()] [Params Validation] Proposal.Params at line 169 in Validate() is never validated. Can attackers inject malicious serialized data to exploit deserialization vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateOrganization()] [TokenSymbol Length] TokenSymbol has no length validation. Can attackers create organizations with excessively long token symbols to cause storage or display issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: ChangeOrganizationThreshold()] [Threshold Range] ProposalReleaseThreshold fields have no maximum value checks. Can an organization set MinimalVoteThreshold to Int64.MaxValue, making all future proposals impossible to release? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateOrganization()] [Event Duplication] OrganizationCreated event is fired at line 34-37 even if organization already exists (early return at line 18). Could this create duplicate events for the same organization? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: Release()] [Event Ordering] ProposalReleased event is fired at line 173 after execution. If execution reverts, is the event still emitted, creating inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedProposer() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [Whitelist Check Timing] ProposerWhiteList is checked at proposal creation, but if whitelist changes before Release(), can unauthorized proposers release proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateOrganizationBySystemContract()] [System Contract Validation] Context.GetSystemContractNameToAddressMapping() returns all system contracts. Does this include contracts that shouldn't create organizations, like token or consensus contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: Release()] [Proposal Lifecycle] After Release() removes proposal at line 174, can users still ReclaimVoteToken? Does this create state inconsistencies in LockedTokenAmount? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: ClearProposal()] [Vote Count Preservation] After ClearProposal, vote counts are lost. If the same proposal is recreated with the same ID, could old vote counts be reused? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: Approve()/Reject()/Abstain()] [Concurrent Voting] Can a user simultaneously Approve, Reject, and Abstain on the same proposal by submitting parallel transactions, locking tokens three times and manipulating all vote counts? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: LockToken() in Referendum_Helper.cs] [Receipt Overwrite] Assert at line 42 checks if LockedTokenAmount exists, but is this check atomic with the set at line 56?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: Release()] [Execution Failure Handling] If SendVirtualInlineBySystemContract at line 169-171 fails, does Release() revert, or does it remove the proposal anyway, preventing retry? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: CreateOrganization()] [CreationToken Manipulation] CreationToken at line 26 is stored but only used in virtual hash calculation. Can attackers manipulate this to control organization virtual addresses or bypass authorization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum.cs] [Function: ChangeOrganizationThreshold()/ChangeOrganizationProposerWhiteList()] [Self-Modification Deadlock] These functions require Context.Sender == organization address.
