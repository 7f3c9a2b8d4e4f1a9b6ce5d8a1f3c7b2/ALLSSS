  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Authorization Bypass] Is there any access control preventing unauthorized callers from invoking this method to clear secret sharing information prematurely, potentially disrupting consensus randomness before proper validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Authorization Bypass] Can a malicious miner call this method on a Round object before secret sharing verification is complete, bypassing InValue recovery and compromising random number generation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Privilege Escalation] If this method is callable from external contracts, can an attacker clear encrypted/decrypted pieces from active consensus rounds, preventing legitimate secret reconstruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [State Manipulation] Does this method verify that the Round has already been persisted to state before clearing secret information, or can it be called on in-memory Round objects still being processed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Race Condition] If multiple threads/transactions access RealTimeMinersInformation.Values concurrently, can the Clear() operations on lines 10 and 13 cause inconsistent state where some miners' data is cleared while others are not? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [State Inconsistency] If EncryptedPieces.Clear() succeeds but DecryptedPieces.Clear() fails, does this create an inconsistent state where encrypted data exists without corresponding decrypted data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Atomicity] Are the multiple Clear() operations in lines 10 and 13 atomic? Can a transaction abort between clearing encrypted and decrypted pieces, leaving partial secret information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Reentrancy] If RealTimeMinersInformation is modified by another method during the foreach loops (lines 10, 13), can this cause collection modification exceptions or skip clearing some miners' data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [State Leak] Does clearing EncryptedPieces and DecryptedPieces actually remove them from persistent storage, or do they remain in blockchain history allowing retrospective secret recovery? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Missing Validation] Does this method verify that secret sharing validation/InValue recovery has completed before clearing, or can it destroy data needed for Byzantine fault detection? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Premature Deletion] If called before RevealSharedInValues completes threshold verification (2/3 miners), does clearing encrypted/decrypted pieces prevent legitimate InValue reconstruction? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Data Loss] Is there any guard against calling this method multiple times, potentially causing errors if Clear() is invoked on already-empty collections? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Incomplete Cleanup] Does this method clear ALL secret-related fields (InValue, PreviousInValue, Signature, RandomNumber) or only EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces, potentially leaving sensitive data exposed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Null Reference] If RealTimeMinersInformation.Values contains null entries, will the Select operations on lines 9 and 12 throw NullReferenceException before any Clear() executes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Protocol Violation] Can an attacker force premature execution of this method during UpdateValue behavior, clearing secret pieces before other miners decrypt them, breaking the secret sharing protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Randomness Compromise] If this method is called before the minimum threshold (2/3) of DecryptedPieces is achieved, does it permanently prevent random number generation for the affected round? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Verification Bypass] Does clearing EncryptedPieces prevent post-consensus auditing of whether miners correctly encrypted their secret shares according to the protocol? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [InValue Recovery] If a miner disputes their revealed PreviousInValue later, can the cleared EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces prevent cryptographic proof of the correct InValue? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Byzantine Detection] Does premature clearing prevent detection of Byzantine miners who provided invalid encrypted pieces or failed to decrypt received pieces? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Timing Attack] Can an adversarial miner delay their UpdateValue transaction until after this method clears other miners' secret pieces, gaining an advantage in random number prediction? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Call Order] If GetConsensusBlockExtraData calls this method (line 50) before all miners in the round have submitted their UpdateValue transactions, does it break secret sharing for late miners? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Round Transition] During NextRound behavior, if this method is called before RevealSharedInValues extracts InValues from the previous round, are critical values permanently lost? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Block Finality] Is this method only safe to call after the round's block is irreversible? If called on a round that gets reorganized, can it cause consensus fork issues? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Memory Leak] Does Clear() on protobuf map fields (EncryptedPieces, DecryptedPieces) actually deallocate memory, or does it leave orphaned byte arrays in the managed heap? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Gas Optimization] For rounds with many miners, do the Select().ToList() operations on lines 9 and 12 create unnecessary intermediate collections, wasting gas? (Low)"
