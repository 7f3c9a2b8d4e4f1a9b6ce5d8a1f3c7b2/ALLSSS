  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: NormalBlockCommandStrategy()] [Input Validation] Can a malicious caller pass a negative or zero previousRoundId to corrupt round tracking, allowing consensus commands to reference invalid or non-existent rounds and potentially bypass round validation checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: NormalBlockCommandStrategy()] [Null Reference] If currentRound is null or contains null RealTimeMinersInformation, will the constructor fail to validate this, leading to null reference exceptions when GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand() accesses CurrentRound properties? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: NormalBlockCommandStrategy()] [State Consistency] Can previousRoundId be set to a future round ID (greater than currentRound.RoundId), creating an impossible state where the 'previous' round is actually in the future, breaking round progression logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: NormalBlockCommandStrategy()] [Round Mismatch] If previousRoundId does not match currentRound.RoundId - 1, can this create inconsistency in consensus hints that allow blocks to be produced with incorrect round references? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: NormalBlockCommandStrategy()] [Time Manipulation] Can currentBlockTime be set to a timestamp far in the past or future to manipulate mining time arrangements and allow miners to produce blocks outside their designated time slots? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: NormalBlockCommandStrategy()] [Pubkey Validation] If pubkey is not present in currentRound.RealTimeMinersInformation, will this be caught at construction time or will it fail later when GetExpectedMiningTime returns Timestamp with long.MaxValue? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Time Manipulation] Can ArrangeNormalBlockMiningTime return a timestamp that violates time slot boundaries, allowing a miner to produce blocks during another miner's time slot or outside the current round? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Integer Overflow] When calculating MiningDueTime via GetExpectedMiningTime(Pubkey).AddMilliseconds(MiningInterval), can an overflow occur if ExpectedMiningTime is near Timestamp.MaxValue, resulting in a wrapped-around due time that allows indefinite mining? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Round ID Mismatch] Can the Hint's RoundId (set to CurrentRound.RoundId) differ from the actual consensus state, allowing stale or future consensus commands to be accepted and processed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Previous Round Reference] If _previousRoundId references a round that has been purged or never existed, will the consensus hint be rejected, or will it allow blocks with invalid historical references to be produced? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Behaviour Type] The Behaviour is hardcoded to UpdateValue - can this strategy be invoked in contexts where UpdateValue is inappropriate (e.g., during term changes or first round), leading to incorrect consensus updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Mining Limit] DefaultBlockMiningLimit is used without validation - can a malicious round configuration set MiningInterval to an extremely small value causing DefaultBlockMiningLimit to become 0 or negative, disabling block mining time limits? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Time Slot Exhaustion] If CurrentRound.GetExpectedMiningTime(Pubkey) returns a time that has already passed significantly, can MiningDueTime be set to a past timestamp, allowing immediate block production bypass of time slot ordering? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Miner Authorization] Does this method verify that Pubkey is actually authorized to mine in CurrentRound, or can unauthorized miners generate valid-looking consensus commands? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Round Transition] If CurrentRound is actually the first round of a new term, should UpdateValue behaviour be used, or does this create an invariant violation where NormalBlockCommandStrategy is used instead of FirstRoundCommandStrategy? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [ArrangedMiningTime Validation] Is there any upper or lower bound checking on arrangedMiningTime returned by ArrangeNormalBlockMiningTime, or can it be arbitrarily far in future/past enabling DoS or time slot violations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [MiningInterval Manipulation] If CurrentRound.GetMiningInterval() returns 0 or negative value due to corrupted round data, does AddMilliseconds fail gracefully or can it produce invalid MiningDueTime causing consensus halts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Hint Serialization] Can the AElfConsensusHint.ToByteString() operation fail or produce malformed data if RoundId or PreviousRoundId are invalid, and is this failure handled? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Command Immutability] After ConsensusCommand is returned, can its fields be modified externally before use, allowing tampering with ArrangedMiningTime or MiningDueTime? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Expected vs Arranged Time Gap] If the gap between GetExpectedMiningTime and arrangedMiningTime is excessively large (e.g., miner delayed by hours), does this enable the miner to mine multiple rounds worth of blocks in quick succession? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Inherited: CurrentRound] If CurrentRound.RealTimeMinersInformation is modified concurrently while GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand executes, can this lead to race conditions where GetExpectedMiningTime uses stale or inconsistent miner data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Inherited: Pubkey] If Pubkey is an empty string or contains invalid characters, will GetExpectedMiningTime handle this gracefully or can it cause lookups to fail with exceptions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Inherited: CurrentBlockTime] If CurrentBlockTime represents a timestamp before blockchain genesis or Unix epoch (negative seconds), can this cause underflows when calculating time differences in ArrangeNormalBlockMiningTime? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Inherited: MiningInterval] If MiningInterval property from CommandStrategyBase returns an inconsistent value between constructor and method execution due to round data changes, can MiningDueTime be calculated incorrectly? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Inherited: DefaultBlockMiningLimit] If TinyBlocksCount constant is changed without recompilation, or if MiningInterval becomes very large, can DefaultBlockMiningLimit exceed system limits causing timeouts?
