  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: RequireSenderAuthority()] [Early Return Exploit] Can an attacker exploit the early return when !State.Initialized.Value to perform actions that should require authority but don't because initialization status bypasses checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: AssertAuthorityByContractInfo()] [Self-Authorization] Can an attacker update Genesis contract itself (contractInfo.Author == Context.Self) without proper governance approval, since the check allows Context.Self as author? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: AssertCurrentMiner()] [Miner Collusion] Can colluding miners approve malicious user contracts by calling ReleaseApprovedUserSmartContract, since only current miner status is checked without requiring consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: IsMainChain()] [Chain Type Spoofing] Can an attacker on a side chain manipulate Context.GetContractAddressByName to return a non-null address for TreasuryContract, making the chain appear as main chain and bypassing user contract deployment restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: CalculateHashFromInput()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker craft two different ContractDeploymentInput objects that produce the same hash from HashHelper.ComputeFrom, causing proposal confusion or denial of service? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeNewContract()] [Hash Preimage Attack] Can an attacker predict the proposedContractInputHash before calling ProposeNewContract and pre-populate State.ContractProposingInputMap to block legitimate proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: RegisterContractProposingData()] [Proposer Impersonation] Can an attacker register proposal data with Context.Sender as proposer, then later claim someone else was the proposer when executing the proposal? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ExtractCodeFromContractCodeCheckInput()] [Parser Exploit] Can an attacker provide malformed input.ContractInput that causes ContractDeploymentInput.Parser or ContractUpdateInput.Parser to fail or behave unexpectedly, bypassing code checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySystemSmartContract()] [Transaction List DOS] Can an attacker include an extremely large TransactionMethodCallList with thousands of inline calls, causing gas exhaustion or timeout during system contract deployment? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeNewContract()] [Proposal Spam] Can an attacker spam the contract with proposal creations, filling up the ContractProposingInputMap and causing high gas costs for all subsequent proposal operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeContractCodeCheck()] [Event Spam] Can an attacker trigger massive CodeCheckRequired events by proposing code checks repeatedly, overwhelming off-chain block producers who must check contract code? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySmartContract() in Helper] [Storage Bloat] Can an attacker deploy contracts with extremely long names (large Hash values), bloating the NameAddressMapping storage and increasing state access costs? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Gas Limit Bypass] Can an attacker set method fees that when combined with AssertValidToken validation loop create a gas consumption scenario that prevents SetMethodFee from ever completing? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeNewContract()] [Category Manipulation] Can an attacker deploy a contract with an arbitrary category value that might bypass security checks in Context.DeploySmartContract or affect contract behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySmartContract() in Helper] [System Contract Impersonation] Can an attacker set isSystemContract to true for a user-deployed contract by manipulating the deployment flow, granting it elevated privileges? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: UpdateSmartContract() in Helper] [User Contract Flag Flip] Can an attacker change isUserContract from false to true or vice versa during update, potentially bypassing authorization checks designed for specific contract types? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySmartContract() in Helper] [Deployer Spoofing] Can an attacker deploy a contract with deployer set to a victim's address if salt-based deployment is used, causing the victim to be liable for the contract's actions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeNewContract()] [Event Confusion] Can an attacker emit multiple ContractProposed events with the same ProposedContractInputHash to confuse off-chain indexers or monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: SetContractAuthor()] [Author Tracking Bypass] Can an attacker bypass off-chain author tracking by updating contracts without triggering AuthorUpdated events through direct state manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySmartContract() in Helper] [Deployment Spoofing] Can an attacker emit fake ContractDeployed events by calling functions that indirectly trigger Context.Fire, misleading off-chain systems about actual deployments? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: SetContractProposerRequiredState()] [Cross-Chain Attack] Can an attacker on the parent chain manipulate the CrossChain contract to trigger SetContractProposerRequiredState on a side chain, disrupting its controller setup? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySystemSmartContract()] [Genesis Address Confusion] Can an attacker exploit the comment about Context.Sender being identical to Genesis contract address to deploy malicious system contracts by impersonating Genesis? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: RequireParliamentContractAddressSet()] [Contract Address Manipulation] Can an attacker deploy a fake Parliament contract at the expected system name before the real one, causing all Parliament references to point to the malicious contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: RequireConsensusContractStateSet()] [Consensus Contract Hijacking] Can an attacker deploy a fake Consensus contract that returns true for IsCurrentMiner for any address, allowing unauthorized user contract approvals?
