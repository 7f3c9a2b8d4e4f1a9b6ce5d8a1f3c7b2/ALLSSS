  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: TryToDetectEvilMiners()] [DOS] If thousands of miners exceed threshold, ToList() creates large collection - can this exhaust memory or gas? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: TryToDetectEvilMiners()] [False Positive] Does function consider extenuating circumstances (network issues, valid forks) before labeling miners as evil, or purely threshold-based? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [State Manipulation Before Hash] Clears EncryptedPieces, DecryptedPieces, ActualMiningTimes - can attacker inject malicious values in these fields, then exploit that they're excluded from hash to hide evidence? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [PreviousInValue Toggle] isContainPreviousInValue parameter optionally sets PreviousInValue to Hash.Empty - if different code paths hash with different settings, can attacker create hash collisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [Clone Safety] Uses RealTimeMinersInformation.Clone() - if Clone() is shallow, do references to inner objects remain shared, allowing mutation after cloning? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [Clear() Side Effects] Clear() on EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces/ActualMiningTimes modifies cloned objects - do these modifications affect original state if Clone() is shallow? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [Dictionary Construction] Creates new Dictionary<string, MinerInRound> but doesn't validate uniqueness of keys - can duplicate keys in iteration cause dictionary initialization to fail or use unexpected values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [Missing Fields] Only copies RoundNumber, TermNumber, RealTimeMinersInformation, BlockchainAge - are other fields like RoundIdForValidation, MinersCountOfConsent intentionally excluded, creating hash discrepancies? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetCheckableRound()] [ToByteArray Determinism] Does Protobuf ToByteArray() guarantee deterministic serialization? Can field order variations cause same logical round to hash differently? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [MinersCountOfConsent Manipulation] Threshold comparison '>= MinersCountOfConsent' - if attacker can modify MinersCountOfConsent field to 0 or large value, can they force/prevent term changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [ActualMiningTimes Manipulation] Filters miners with Any() ActualMiningTimes, then uses Last() - can attacker inject fake future timestamps in ActualMiningTimes list to trigger premature term change? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [Two-Thirds Confusion] Comment says 'two thirds' but code uses MinersCountOfConsent - is MinersCountOfConsent properly set to 2/3 of miner count, or can it be manipulated to different threshold? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [Empty ActualMiningTimes] Where(m => m.ActualMiningTimes.Any()) filters out inactive miners - if all miners are filtered out, Count() is 0 which is >= 0, potentially passing check with no actual consensus? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [Timestamp Ordering] Uses Last() on ActualMiningTimes without ensuring chronological order - if list is unordered, Last() doesn't give latest time, breaking term change logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [Integer Division] IsTimeToChangeTerm() performs division on seconds - can attacker craft blockchainStartTimestamp/periodSeconds to make division always fail term-change condition? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: NeedToChangeTerm()] [Race Condition] Iterates RealTimeMinersInformation.Values and calls Last() on ActualMiningTimes - can concurrent mining during iteration cause inconsistent count? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: IsTimeToChangeTerm()] [Division By Zero] If periodSeconds is 0, Div(periodSeconds) causes division by zero exception - can attacker set periodSeconds to 0 in initialization to DOS term changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: IsTimeToChangeTerm()] [Timestamp Underflow] (blockProducedTimestamp - blockchainStartTimestamp) could be negative if blockProducedTimestamp < blockchainStartTimestamp - does negative Seconds value cause incorrect division result? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: IsTimeToChangeTerm()] [Off-By-One Logic] Comment explains 'termNumber - 1' comparison, but is boundary handling correct? At exact period boundary, does term change too early/late by one period? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: IsTimeToChangeTerm()] [Negative Period] No validation that periodSeconds is positive - can negative period cause division to produce negative result, breaking inequality check? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: IsTimeToChangeTerm()] [Large Period] If periodSeconds is very large (e.g., long.MaxValue), division result is always 0, preventing term changes ever? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: IsTimeToChangeTerm()] [Term Number Overflow] No check that termNumber is positive - if termNumber <= 0, 'termNumber - 1' could be negative, breaking comparison logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetAbsModulus()] [Unused Function] Function is defined but never called in this file - is it part of public API that external code relies on? Can attacker exploit if assumptions about modulus behavior differ? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetAbsModulus()] [Division By Zero] Modulus operation 'longValue % intValue' throws exception if intValue is 0 - is there input validation in callers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetAbsModulus()] [Integer Overflow] Cast to int of Math.Abs(long) could overflow if absolute value > int.MaxValue - does overflow wrap to negative int? (Medium)"
