  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic: Special Case] [Batch Operation Abuse] The hardcoded IsSizeFeeFree for ApproveMultiProposals could allow attackers to submit massive batch approvals without size fees, causing state bloat. Is there any other rate limiting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Invariant: Controller Uniqueness] [Violation] Can State.MethodFeeController.Value ever become null after proper initialization, breaking the invariant that there's always a valid controller? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Invariant: Fee Validity] [Violation] Can State.TransactionFees ever contain fees for tokens that are no longer valid for method fees, breaking the fee collection mechanism? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Invariant: Authorization Chain] [Violation] Can the OwnerAddress in AuthorityInfo point to an address that has no relationship with the ContractAddress's organization logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Invariant: Default Organization] [Violation] Should State.DefaultOrganizationAddress.Value ever change after initialization, and if so, does this affect existing fee controller configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input: MethodName] Can input.MethodName contain special characters, Unicode, or null bytes that cause storage key corruption or collision? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input: Fees Array] If input.Fees is null rather than empty, will the foreach loop throw or skip validation, allowing null fee configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input: Symbol] Can methodFee.Symbol be set to existing native token symbols to confuse fee collection between different token types? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input: BasicFee] If BasicFee is set to exactly Int64.MaxValue, can subsequent fee calculations overflow when adding size-based fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Input: AuthorityInfo] If both input.OwnerAddress and input.ContractAddress are null, will CheckOrganizationExist properly reject this? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Input: ContractAddress] Can input.ContractAddress point to Context.Self, creating a circular authorization reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Input: StringValue] If input.Value exceeds maximum string length, can this cause storage lookup to fail or return incorrect fees? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Input: Amount] Can amount be set to exactly zero to bypass fee charging while still passing validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Error Handling: AssertValidToken()] If State.TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee throws an exception, is this caught or does it cause the entire SetMethodFee transaction to revert? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Error Handling: CheckOrganizationExist()] If Context.Call to ValidateOrganizationExist fails due to target contract not existing, is this handled gracefully or does it revert ChangeMethodFeeController? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case: Empty Fees] If input.Fees is an empty list, SetMethodFee creates a MethodFees entry with MethodName but no actual fees. Does this default to free method calls? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case: Duplicate MethodName] Can multiple SetMethodFee calls for the same MethodName cause fee accumulation or only the last setting applies? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case: Controller Self-Reference] If the controller is changed to point back to the Parliament contract itself, does this create logical issues in authorization checking? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Performance: SetMethodFee()] If input.Fees contains hundreds of tokens, each requiring an external call to IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee, can this exceed block gas limits? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Performance: ChangeMethodFeeController()] The CheckOrganizationExist external call has unbounded gas consumption. Can a malicious organization contract deliberately consume all available gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Performance: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] Being called on every operation when controller is unset, can this add significant overhead to first-time fee operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Gas: State Reads] Multiple reads of State.MethodFeeController.Value in different functions - is this optimized or does each read cost full storage gas? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/ParliamentContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ACS1 Compliance: GetMethodFee()] The special case for ApproveMultiProposals returns IsSizeFeeFree without checking stored configuration. Is this allowed by ACS1 or a deviation? (Medium)"
