  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Behavior Branch Consistency] The special case for Order == 1 with UpdateValue (lines 35-36) differs from other strategies. Is this intentional design, or could it create timing inconsistencies when validators compare commands from different strategies? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Extension Method Trust] Lines 37 uses extension methods (Add, Sub, Mul) on integers. If these methods have bugs or unexpected behavior with edge case inputs, will FirstRoundCommandStrategy propagate these issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Timestamp Extension Trust] Line 44 uses AddMilliseconds on Timestamp. If this Google.Protobuf.WellKnownTypes extension has overflow or precision issues, will MiningDueTime be calculated incorrectly? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Network Partition] If nodes have slightly different CurrentBlockTime values (due to clock skew), will they calculate different arrangedMiningTimes for the same miner, causing nodes to disagree on valid mining windows? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Byzantine Miner] If a Byzantine miner provides false Order, MinersCount, or MiningInterval values in their CurrentRound data, will FirstRoundCommandStrategy generate incorrect commands that honest nodes might accept if validation is insufficient? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: FirstRoundCommandStrategy()] [Multiple Instantiation] Can FirstRoundCommandStrategy be instantiated multiple times for the same round with different parameters, creating conflicting consensus commands for the same miner? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/FirstRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Constructor: FirstRoundCommandStrategy()] [Caller Authorization] Is there any check ensuring only authorized components (like GetConsensusCommand) can instantiate FirstRoundCommandStrategy, or can arbitrary code create instances with malicious parameters? (Medium)"
