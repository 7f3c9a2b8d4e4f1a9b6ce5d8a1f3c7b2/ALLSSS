  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Manipulation] [Controller Overwrite] ChangeMethodFeeController() overwrites State.MethodFeeController.Value at line 29 - can this be exploited during concurrent transactions to skip validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Manipulation] [No Fee Deletion] There's no mechanism to delete entries from State.TransactionFees - can this cause permanent state bloat and prevent reverting to default fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Manipulation] [Initialization Lock] Once RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() sets State.MethodFeeController.Value at line 82, it can't be reset to null - can this prevent emergency reinitialization if controller becomes invalid? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Empty MethodName] SetMethodFee() doesn't validate input.MethodName - can passing empty string or special characters corrupt State.TransactionFees mapping? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Duplicate Symbols] SetMethodFee() doesn't check for duplicate symbols in input.Fees - can an attacker set multiple fees with same symbol but different BasicFee values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Symbol Length] AssertValidToken() doesn't validate symbol string length - can extremely long symbols cause storage issues or DOS? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Null AuthorityInfo] ChangeMethodFeeController() doesn't check if input is null before accessing input.ContractAddress at line 26 - can this cause null reference exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [ContractAddress Validation] No validation that input.ContractAddress in ChangeMethodFeeController() is a valid contract - can setting non-contract addresses break CheckOrganizationExist()?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Token Contract Dependency] State.TokenContract initialization at line 101-102 uses SmartContractConstants.TokenContractSystemName - can this fail if Token contract is renamed or replaced? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Authorization Contract Interface] CheckOrganizationExist() assumes authorization contracts implement ValidateOrganizationExist() - can interface changes break this assumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Context.Variables.NativeSymbol] GetMethodFee() hardcodes Context.Variables.NativeSymbol at lines 47 and 55 - can changes to native symbol break default fee collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Access Control] [Controller vs Owner] Does State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress represent a single EOA or can it be a contract/multisig - if contract, who controls the controller? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Access Control] [Parliament Default Authority] RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() automatically grants control to Parliament default organization - can Parliament members abuse this to manipulate fees? (High)",
