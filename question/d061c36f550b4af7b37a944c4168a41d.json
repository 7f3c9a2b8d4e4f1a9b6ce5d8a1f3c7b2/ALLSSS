  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetValidationDataCenterCount()] [Logic Error] Multiplying by 5 is hardcoded - if governance changes this ratio but code isn't updated, can this cause validation issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateAdmin()] [Logic Error] Uses State.InitialPubkeyMap[input.Value] ?? input.Value to get the key - if InitialPubkeyMap returns empty string, can this cause incorrect admin lookup? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateAdmin()] [Null Reference] If State.CandidateAdmins[...] returns null, the default Address could be invalid - is there handling for missing admins? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateAdmin()] [Authorization Bypass] If InitialPubkeyMap is manipulated to point to wrong admins, can this allow unauthorized admin operations on candidates? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetReplacedPubkey()] [Data Integrity] Returns State.CandidateReplacementMap[input.Value] directly - if this map is corrupted or stale, can it return incorrect replacement info? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetReplacedPubkey()] [Null Return] If no replacement exists, returns empty StringValue - can consuming contracts distinguish between no replacement vs. error? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetSponsor()] [Logic Error] Falls back to Address.FromPublicKey if no sponsor in map - but if input.Value is not a valid pubkey hex, can this throw exceptions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetSponsor()] [Authorization Bypass] If CandidateSponsorMap can be manipulated, can an attacker change sponsor to gain unauthorized benefits or fee refunds? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetSponsor()] [Null Reference] ByteArrayHelper.HexStringToByteArray(input.Value) could throw on invalid hex - is there validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetManagedPubkeys()] [Null Return] Returns State.ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap[input] which could be null - should it return empty PubkeyList instead? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetManagedPubkeys()] [Authorization Bypass] If ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap is not properly maintained, can this return incorrect candidate lists allowing unauthorized management? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVictories() + GetValidCandidates()] [Race Condition] GetVictories calls GetValidCandidates which reads State.CandidateVotes - between these reads, can vote amounts change causing inconsistent miner selection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVictories() + GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [Data Inconsistency] If GetVictories uses GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey that mutates snapshots, can concurrent calls corrupt each other's data? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVote() + GetCandidateVote()] [State Consistency] If elector votes for a candidate but CandidateVotes doesn't reflect it due to timing, can this cause accounting mismatches in rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord() + GetNewestPubkey()] [Logic Error] If GetNewestPubkey returns a chain of replacements, can vote records be attributed to wrong candidates? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation() + GetEvilMinersPubkeys()] [Timing Attack] If BannedPubkeyMap is updated between these calls, can it result in incorrect replacement counts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation() + GetCandidateVote()] [DOS Attack] Nested view function calls - if each GetCandidateVote is expensive and pagination requests max length, can this amplify gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVictories()] [Logic Error] When validCandidates.Count < State.MinersCount.Value and backups are added, if backups.Count also < diff, can the final victories list be shorter than MinersCount? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVictories()] [Determinism Issue] OrderBy(p => p) uses string ordering - if two pubkeys are case-insensitive duplicates, can this cause non-deterministic selection across nodes? (High)",
