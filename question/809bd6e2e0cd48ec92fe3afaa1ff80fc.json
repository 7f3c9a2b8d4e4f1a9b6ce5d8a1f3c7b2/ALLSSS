  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs] [Function: ValidateBeforeExecution()] [Single Miner Genesis Attack] At line 23-43, the single-miner bypass allows validation skip. During chain genesis when only one miner is configured, can that miner produce arbitrary blocks without consensus checks, potentially embedding backdoors or invalid state in the genesis blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs] [Function: ValidateBeforeExecution()] [Historical Round Immutability] The loop at lines 28-41 assumes historical rounds (State.Rounds[i] for i < current) are immutable. If they can be modified by other contract methods, can an attacker change history to manipulate the single-miner check result? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs] [Function: ValidateBeforeExecution()] [Validation Service Statelessness] HeaderInformationValidationService (line 94) is instantiated per validation call. If it should maintain state across validations but doesn't, can this allow replay attacks or prevent detection of multi-block attack patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs] [Function: ValidateBeforeExecution()] [ExtraData Signature Verification] The method receives extraData but never explicitly verifies its cryptographic signature before using it. Can an attacker forge extraData with invalid signatures that pass this validation but fail later signature checks, causing DOS or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs] [Function: ValidateBeforeExecution()] [Behavior-Specific Recovery Order] RecoverFromUpdateValue (line 47) is called for UpdateValue, and RecoverFromTinyBlock (line 50) for TinyBlock. If the order of these recoveries matters for correctness, and both conditions somehow become true, which recovery wins, and can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs] [Function: ValidateBeforeExecution()] [Context.CurrentHeight Trustworthiness] At line 24, Context.CurrentHeight is used in a security check. If CurrentHeight can be manipulated (e.g., through block header tampering), can attackers bypass the early-block validation\n\n### Citations\n\n**File:** contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs (L16-104)\n```csharp\n    private ValidationResult ValidateBeforeExecution(AElfConsensusHeaderInformation extraData)\n    {\n        // According to current round information:\n        if (!TryToGetCurrentRoundInformation(out var baseRound))\n            return new ValidationResult { Success = false, Message ="
