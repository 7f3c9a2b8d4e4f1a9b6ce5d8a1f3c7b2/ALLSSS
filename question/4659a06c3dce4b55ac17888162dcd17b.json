  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Deserialization Issue] After deserializing ProposerWhiteList from storage, if Proposers field is uninitialized vs empty array, does Empty() correctly distinguish these states? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Protobuf Issue] If Address in Proposers list was serialized with different protobuf version, does Contains() comparison work correctly or fail silently allowing authorization bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Reentrancy] If Contains() triggers any callbacks or events during Address comparison, can attacker re-enter and modify whitelist mid-check allowing unauthorized proposal? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Reentrancy] During Empty() execution in Validate(), if Count() allows reentrant calls that modify Proposers collection, can validation pass with temporarily valid but ultimately invalid whitelist?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Cross-Contract Bug] When AssertIsAuthorizedProposer is called from CreateProposalBySystemContract with OriginProposer, does Contains() check the right address or can system contract bypass whitelist? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [System Contract Bypass] In CreateOrganizationBySystemContract, if Empty() validation is skipped for system contracts, can they create organizations with empty whitelists breaking proposal creation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Lifecycle Bug] After proposal is created, if proposer is removed from whitelist, does subsequent Release() require Contains() check, or can removed proposer still release their proposals? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Organization Lock] If whitelist becomes empty after proposals exist, does Empty() check in any operation prevent clearing expired proposals, permanently locking them in storage? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Logic Inversion] Is the comparison Count() == 0 vulnerable to logic inversion attacks if Count() returns unexpected values like int.MaxValue wrapping to 0? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Type Confusion] If Proposers collection is replaced with different ICollection implementation, does Count() property access have different semantics causing Empty() to return wrong value? (Low)",
