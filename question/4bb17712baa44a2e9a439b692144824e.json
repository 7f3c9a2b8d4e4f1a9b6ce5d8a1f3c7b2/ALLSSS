  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [ACS1 Completeness Invariant] ACS1 implementations should provide complete fee management, but 3 of 4 methods are no-ops - is contract considered incomplete/unsafe for production? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Proposal Execution Failure] Parliament proposals calling SetMethodFee will succeed but have no effect - does this waste gas and confuse governance participants? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Proposal Execution Failure] Parliament proposals to change controller will execute but not persist changes - can this cause governance deadlock? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Proposal Creation Failure] Parliament CreateProposal for NFT fees needs valid ToAddress from GetMethodFeeController - does empty return prevent proposals from being created? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Size Fee Missing] MethodFees returned for Create does not set IsSizeFeeFree - will Create transactions pay both 100 ELF basic fee AND size-based fees, making it more expensive than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Size Fee Configuration] Non-Create methods return empty MethodFees - are they charged size fees by default, or are they completely free? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Fee Collection Point] Who collects the 100 ELF Create fee - is it burned, sent to Treasury, or distributed to Profit pools? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Fee Token Burnability] The native symbol fee must be burnable for collection - does implementation verify Context.Variables.NativeSymbol has IsBurnable=true? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Exception Handling] No try-catch around Context.Variables.NativeSymbol access - if Variables is null or throws, can it crash the query? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [Empty Return Validation] Returning Empty() without operations is valid C# - but does ACS1 runtime expect certain events or logs that are missing? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Cross-Chain Fee Consistency] NFTContract_Create.cs restricts Create to AELF mainchain - should method fees differ between mainchain and sidechains? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Side-Chain Deployment] If NFT contract is deployed to sidechain, will Context.Variables.NativeSymbol be correct (e.g., side chain native token instead of ELF)? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [MultiToken Pattern Deviation] MultiToken's SetMethodFee validates fee tokens with AssertValidFeeToken - why does NFT contract omit this critical check? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Parliament Pattern Deviation] Parliament contracts validate organization existence before accepting controller - why does NFT contract skip CheckOrganizationExist? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Default Authority Pattern] All system contracts initialize controller to Parliament default organization - why does NFT return empty instead? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Method Exemption Pattern] MultiToken exempts system methods (ClaimTransactionFees, etc.) from fees - should NFT similarly exempt certain operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [Stub Deployment Risk] If this stub implementation is deployed to mainnet, can it be upgraded to proper ACS1 without breaking existing fee configurations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Hard-Fork Fee Change] The 100 ELF hardcoded fee can only be changed via contract upgrade/hard-fork - is this acceptable for mainnet, or should it be governable? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Future Implementation Risk] If SetMethodFee is implemented later, existing empty calls may have been cached or assumed safe - can activation cause unexpected state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Interface Documentation Mismatch] ACS1 proto documents 'override all fees of the method' - does empty implementation violate this documented contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Interface Documentation Mismatch] ACS1 proto documents 'default is parliament and default organization' - does returning empty AuthorityInfo violate this specification? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Method Name Collision] If multiple methods normalize to 'Create' after protobuf compilation, could wrong fees be returned? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Negative Fee Input] No validation prevents negative BasicFee values in input.Fees - could negative fees cause accounting bugs if implemented? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Empty Fees Array] If input.Fees is empty array, should SetMethodFee remove fees for that method or reject the input? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Return Value Caching] Does ACS1 runtime cache GetMethodFee results - if so, can hardcoded value cause caching issues during upgrades? (Low)"
