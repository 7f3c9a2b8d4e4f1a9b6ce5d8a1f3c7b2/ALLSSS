  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker call InitialElectionContract through a reentrant callback before State.Initialized is set to true, bypassing the initialization check and re-initializing critical state variables like MinimumLockTime, MaximumLockTime, and CurrentTermNumber? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a MinimumLockTime greater than MaximumLockTime in the InitialElectionContractInput, creating an invalid lock time range that breaks subsequent vote locking logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide a zero or negative TimeEachTerm value that would break term duration calculations in the consensus contract and election snapshot logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide an empty MinerList in InitialElectionContractInput, setting MinersCount to zero and breaking miner selection logic throughout the system? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide duplicate pubkeys in the MinerList, causing the same miner to be counted multiple times and corrupting the initial miner set? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker provide invalid hex strings in MinerList that would fail in ByteStringHelper.FromHexString but after MinersCount is already set, leaving the contract in an inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [State Corruption] Does InitialElectionContract create CandidateInformation entries for initial miners without setting critical fields like ProducedBlocks or MissedTimeSlots, potentially causing null reference exceptions or math errors in later operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Business Logic] Can CurrentTermNumber being initialized to 1 instead of 0 cause off-by-one errors in term-based calculations, snapshot indexing, or profit distribution periods? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Authorization] Does InitialElectionContract lack authorization checks, allowing any address to initialize the contract if they win the race condition before State.Initialized is set? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [State Corruption] Can an attacker exploit the fact that DataCentersRankingList is initialized as empty but initial miners are added to CandidateInformationMap, creating a mismatch where initial miners have candidate info but are not in the ranking list? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker exploit a reentrancy vulnerability by calling RegisterElectionVotingEvent before State.VotingEventRegistered is set to true, registering multiple voting events and corrupting the MinerElectionVotingItemId? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Authorization] Does RegisterElectionVotingEvent lack authorization checks, allowing any external address to register the voting event and potentially front-run the legitimate initialization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Business Logic] Can the voting event being registered with IsLockToken set to false allow voters to vote without locking tokens, enabling vote manipulation through flash loan attacks or double voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Input Validation] Can TotalSnapshotNumber being set to long.MaxValue cause integer overflow issues in the Vote contract's snapshot counting logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Business Logic] Can StartTimestamp being set to TimestampHelper.MinValue and EndTimestamp to TimestampHelper.MaxValue create edge cases where timestamp comparisons overflow or fail validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Hash Collision] Can the MinerElectionVotingItemId hash computation using HashHelper.ConcatAndCompute collide with other voting item IDs, allowing vote manipulation across different voting events? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [State Corruption] If State.VoteContract.Register.Send fails or reverts, will State.VotingEventRegistered still be set to true, preventing future registration attempts and leaving the contract non-functional? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Cross-Contract] Can an attacker deploy a malicious contract at the VoteContract address before RegisterElectionVotingEvent is called, capturing control of the voting mechanism? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the sender check by exploiting a race condition where GetEmergencyResponseOrganizationAddress returns null or an attacker-controlled address during initialization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Logic Error] If candidateInformation is null for a given pubkey, the function returns Empty without updating anything. Can this be exploited to prevent legitimate candidate updates by ensuring candidate info is never initialized? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [State Inconsistency] When marking a node as evil, the function removes it from Candidates, DataCentersRankingList, and CandidateInformationMap. Can incomplete removal due to transaction revert or DOS create orphaned state entries? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Integer Overflow] Can ProducedBlocks and MissedTimeSlots be incremented without bounds using the Add method, causing integer overflow that wraps values back to zero or negative, corrupting reputation scores? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [DOS] Can an attacker call UpdateCandidateInformation with IsEvilNode=true for all candidates in sequence, depleting the candidate pool and making the consensus unable to select miners? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [State Corruption] When setting DataCenters[input.Pubkey] = 0 and calling UpdateDataCenterAfterMemberVoteAmountChanged, can this create inconsistencies where the pubkey remains in the ranking list with zero votes instead of being removed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Business Logic] Does removing an evil node from Candidates but not checking if they are currently an active miner allow evil miners to continue producing blocks until the next term transition? (High)"
