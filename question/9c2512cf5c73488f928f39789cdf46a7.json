  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [PreviousInValue Race Condition] Lines 14-16 check and set PreviousInValue non-atomically - can two concurrent calls both pass the null/empty check and set different values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Conflict List Staleness] Line 25 creates conflicts list from current state, but lines 28-40 execute later - can state changes between query and modification cause incorrect conflict resolution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [ToList Materialization Overhead] Line 26 calls ToList() on LINQ query - with large miner sets, can this cause excessive memory allocation and GC pressure? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Nested Loop Complexity] Outer loop on line 28 over conflicts, inner loop on line 31 up to 2*minersCount, and All() on line 34 over all miners - can this O(c*n*m) complexity cause DOS where c=conflicts, n=positions, m=miners? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Pubkey String Comparison] Line 36 uses orderConflictedMiner.Pubkey - are pubkey string comparisons case-sensitive? Can case variations cause lookup failures? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Order Exceeds Miner Count] Conflict resolution on lines 31-40 can assign orders up to 2*minersCount - is there downstream validation that FinalOrderOfNextRound <= minersCount? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Silent Early Return] Line 10 silently returns original Round if pubkey not found - can this cause confusion where calling code assumes success but state wasn't modified? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [No Event Emission] Function modifies critical consensus state but doesn't emit events - can this make attack detection and monitoring impossible? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Signature Reuse Across Rounds] No validation that signature is unique to this round - can miners reuse previous round signatures to save computation, breaking randomness? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [OutValue Without Proof] Line 12 accepts outValue without VRF proof verification - can miners submit arbitrary outValues breaking verifiable randomness? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Break Statement Dependency] Line 38 break is critical for loop termination - if condition on line 34 never true (all positions occupied), does loop continue to i=2*minersCount causing gas exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Conflict Resolution Fairness] Lines 31-40 resolve conflicts by sequential search - does this unfairly penalize certain miners who happen to conflict with popular orders? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Order Assignment Gap] If supposed orders cluster around certain values, conflict resolution may create large gaps in order sequence - can this break time slot calculation assumptions?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Supposed vs Final Order Discrepancy] Lines 42-44 set both SupposedOrderOfNextRound and FinalOrderOfNextRound - is there semantic difference? Can large discrepancies between them cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Parameter Validation Order] Pubkey check on line 10 happens before any other validation - can this allow attackers to probe which pubkeys are valid miners? (Low)",
