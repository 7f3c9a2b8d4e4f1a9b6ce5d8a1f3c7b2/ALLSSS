  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingResult)] [VotingItemId Validation] Since VotingItemId is a Hash type that could be arbitrary, does GetHash validate that VotingItemId corresponds to an actual registered voting item before computing the result hash, or could attackers generate hashes for non-existent items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash overloads] [Type Confusion] Could a malicious contract pass objects that implement both VotingRegisterInput and VotingResult interfaces (if such multiple inheritance were possible) to trigger ambiguous method resolution and incorrect hash computation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingRegisterInput, Address)] [Serialization Bugs] If HashHelper.ComputeFrom has bugs when serializing ProtoBuf messages with cleared repeated fields (like Options after Clear()), could it produce incorrect hashes or throw exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingResult)] [Minimal Object Construction] Creating a VotingResult with only VotingItemId and SnapshotNumber set—are other fields initialized to safe defaults by the constructor, or could uninitialized fields cause undefined behavior in HashHelper.ComputeFrom? (Low)"
