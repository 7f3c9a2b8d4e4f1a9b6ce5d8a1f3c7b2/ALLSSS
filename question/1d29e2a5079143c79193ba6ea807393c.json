  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [LIB Manipulation] Can an attacker provide a Round with ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight = 0, causing LIB reset and enabling deep chain reorganizations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [LIB Manipulation] Can an attacker provide inconsistent ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight and ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockRoundNumber, breaking LIB-based finality assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [Consensus] Can an attacker reset MissedTimeSlots in RealTimeMinersInformation before Create(), allowing evil miners to escape detection and punishment? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: ToRound()] [Consensus] When ProcessNextTerm resets MissedTimeSlots after ToRound(), can this be exploited to clear penalties accumulated in the previous term improperly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [Architecture] Does Create() perform ANY validation on input parameters, or does it blindly copy fields enabling arbitrary malicious data injection? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: ToRound()] [Architecture] Does ToRound() perform ANY validation before returning Round, or can it return structurally invalid Round objects to ProcessNextTerm? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [Architecture] Is there validation of field ranges (e.g., term number, round number, heights) in Create(), or are overflows and underflows silently ignored? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [Architecture] Does Create() validate that RealTimeMinersInformation keys are properly formatted hexadecimal public keys, or can arbitrary strings be used? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: Create()] [Architecture] Does Create() check for minimum randomNumber length to ensure sufficient entropy, or can a single-byte randomNumber be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/NextTermInput.cs] [Function: ToRound()] [Architecture] Does ToRound() ensure RealTimeMinersInformation is not null before collection copy, or can this cause runtime exceptions? (Medium)"
