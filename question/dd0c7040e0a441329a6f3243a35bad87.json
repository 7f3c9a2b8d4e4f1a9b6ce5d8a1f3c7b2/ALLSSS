  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Method Name Collision] Can TransactionFees[methodName] be exploited through case sensitivity or whitespace manipulation to create duplicate method name entries with different fees, bypassing fee controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Missing Cleanup] Does TransactionFees[methodName] persist for deprecated methods without removal mechanism, allowing state bloat and potential confusion where obsolete fee configurations interfere with current operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Token Validation Bypass] Can TransactionFees[methodName] be set with invalid token symbols that bypass TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee checks if validation is missing or occurs after state update? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Authority Hijacking] Can MethodFeeController.Value be overwritten by exploiting missing access controls in ChangeMethodFeeController(), allowing an attacker to gain control over fee management and set all fees to zero? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Initialization Attack] Is MethodFeeController.Value vulnerable to front-running during initial setup, where an attacker can set themselves as controller before the legitimate Parliament organization is configured? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Null Pointer] Can MethodFeeController.Value remain null in edge cases where RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() fails, causing null pointer exceptions or bypassing fee controller authorization checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Invalid Authority] Does MethodFeeController.Value lack validation ensuring ContractAddress is a legitimate governance contract, allowing attackers to set bogus authorities that always return true for validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Reentrancy] Can reentrancy during external ValidateOrganizationExist calls modify MethodFeeController.Value, causing TOCTOU vulnerabilities where authority validation succeeds but controller changes before use? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Circular Dependency] If MethodFeeController.Value.ContractAddress points to AssociationContract itself, can this create circular authorization logic allowing unauthorized fee changes through self-validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: MethodFeeController] [Missing Validation] Does MethodFeeController.Value allow OwnerAddress to be zero address or null, bypassing sender address checks in SetMethodFee() and allowing anyone to modify fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Cross-State] [Consistency Violation] Can Organizations[address] and Proposals[proposalId] become inconsistent if organization is modified (thresholds, members) while active proposals reference it, causing proposals to be releasable under old rules but executing under new ones? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Cross-State] [Orphaned Proposals] If Organizations[address] is deleted or replaced, do Proposals[proposalId] with that OrganizationAddress become orphaned and unreleasable, locking any assets or actions they were meant to execute? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Cross-State] [Fee Controller Bypass] Can an attacker create an organization, make it the MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress, then manipulate TransactionFees[methodName] through proposal execution to set fees to zero? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Cross-State] [State Migration] If state schema changes require migration, can inconsistencies between Organizations, Proposals, TransactionFees, and MethodFeeController cause authorization failures or enable bypass attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Architecture] [Missing Events] Does the state definition lack event emission infrastructure, preventing proper monitoring of critical state changes like organization creation, proposal lifecycle, or fee modifications? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Architecture] [No State Versioning] Does the state definition lack version tracking, making it impossible to handle breaking changes or detect when state was migrated from incompatible schemas? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Architecture] [Missing Indices] Do Organizations and Proposals lack secondary indices (e.g., by proposer, by expiry time), forcing inefficient full scans that could enable DOS through state enumeration attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Architecture] [Unbounded State Growth] Is there no mechanism to limit total Organizations or Proposals count, allowing unbounded state growth that could cause blockchain bloat and degraded performance over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Architecture] [Missing Access Control Layer] Does the state definition lack built-in access control modifiers (e.g., [Authorized], [OnlyController]), relying entirely on consuming contract code for security checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Architecture] [No State Snapshots] Is there no snapshot or checkpoint mechanism for Organizations and Proposals, preventing rollback or recovery if state corruption is detected? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Reference State] [Contract Resolution] Can ParliamentContract or TokenContract references be uninitialized or point to malicious contracts if AssociationReferenceState initialization fails or is front-run during deployment? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Reference State] [Circular Calls] If ParliamentContract.Value points to an organization within Organizations[address], can circular dependency cause stack overflow or infinite loops during validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [Reference State] [Missing Validation] Are ParliamentContract and TokenContract references validated to ensure they implement required interfaces before use, or can type mismatches cause runtime failures? (High)"
