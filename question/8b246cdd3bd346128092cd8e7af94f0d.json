  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Multi-Round Attack] An attacker who controls the minimum threshold of miners could: (1) provide invalid DecryptedPieces in round N-1, (2) call RevealSharedInValues in round N with their publicKey, (3) cause all reveals to fail at line 36, (4) freeze consensus as no PreviousInValues are set. Is this prevented? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Sybil + Secret Sharing] If an attacker creates Sybil identities that all become miners, they could control > 2/3 of miners, satisfy the minimumCount threshold with colluding shares, and reveal fake InValues for honest miners. Can this corrupt the entire consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Time-Travel Attack] If an attacker can call RevealSharedInValues with future round data (currentRound is round N+1, previousRound is round N+2), can they pre-reveal secrets that shouldn't be known yet? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Griefing via Gas] A malicious miner could craft DecryptedPieces with maximum size to cause line 46-47's ToList() to consume excessive gas, preventing other miners from successfully calling RevealSharedInValues due to block gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: IsSecretSharingEnabled() + RevealSharedInValues()] [Configuration Disable Attack] If an attacker gains control of the Configuration contract and sets SecretSharingEnabled to false after secrets are shared, can subsequent reveals fail, leaving PreviousInValues unset and breaking consensus validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [OrderBy Gas Cost] Line 25's OrderBy creates a sorted copy of RealTimeMinersInformation. For 1000+ miners, does this consume excessive gas making the function uncallable? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [First() Enumeration] Lines 42-43 call First() which enumerates until a match is found. In worst case, this is O(n) per decrypted piece. With m pieces and n miners, is O(m*n) acceptable? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Select Materialization] Line 40 uses Select which is lazy evaluated, but ToList() at line 44 forces materialization. Can an attacker provide data that causes Select to throw exceptions during materialization? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [DecodeSecret Complexity] SecretSharingHelper.DecodeSecret performs polynomial interpolation which is computationally expensive. If minimumCount is very large, can this exceed block gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [MinersCount vs Current Miners] Line 21 uses currentRound.RealTimeMinersInformation.Count but line 36 checks against minersCount. If miners are added/removed between these lines, can the counts diverge causing incorrect validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [EncryptedPieces Threshold Gap] Line 35 requires EncryptedPieces.Count >= minimumCount. But there's no upper bound check. Can a miner provide 1000s of encrypted pieces to waste storage or processing? (Low)",
