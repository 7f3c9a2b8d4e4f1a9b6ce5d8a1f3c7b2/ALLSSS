  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_UseChain.cs] [AddMinters/RemoveMinters/Burn/Recast] [Minter List Consistency] Can modifications to the minter list via AddMinters (line 345) or RemoveMinters (line 365) affect ongoing Burn (line 92) or Recast (line 260) operations, causing authorization bypasses? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_UseChain.cs] [PerformMint/Burn] [Supply Invariant] Can the supply tracking across PerformMint (lines 403-405) and Burn (lines 95-96) diverge if concurrent operations cause atomicity violations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_UseChain.cs] [ApproveProtocol/TransferFrom] [Operator Privilege] Can operator status granted via ApproveProtocol (line 252) be revoked during an ongoing TransferFrom (line 61) operation, causing inconsistent transfer outcomes? (Medium)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_UseChain.cs] [Function: Transfer()/TransferFrom()] [Double-Spend Race] Can an attacker initiate two Transfer calls with the same tokenHash concurrently, exploiting race conditions in DoTransfer balance checks at line 52 to spend the same tokens twice? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_UseChain.cs] [Function: Approve()/TransferFrom()] [Allowance Front-Running] Can an attacker monitor pending Approve transactions at line 298 and front-run with TransferFrom at line 57 to exploit both old and new allowances? (High)",
