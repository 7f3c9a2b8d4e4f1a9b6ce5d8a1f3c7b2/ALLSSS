  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Authorization Bypass] Are ParliamentContract references validated to match expected system contract address, or can attacker deploy fake parliament returning attacker as default organization address? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: TreasuryContract] [Fund Theft] Is TreasuryContract address validated before ReplaceCandidateProfitsReceiver calls, preventing attacker from setting malicious treasury contract that redirects all candidate profits? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: VoteContract] [Data Integrity] Can attacker replace VoteContract reference mid-execution to point at contract returning fake voting records with manipulated amounts or timestamps? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ProfitContract] [Accounting Error] If ProfitContract reference changes between AddBeneficiary and RemoveBeneficiary calls, can beneficiaries get stuck unable to withdraw welfare profits? (Medium)",
