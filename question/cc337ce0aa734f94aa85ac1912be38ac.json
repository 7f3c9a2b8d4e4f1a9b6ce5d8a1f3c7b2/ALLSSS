  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: CheckSymbolIdentifier()] [Array Bounds] The function checks words[0] and words[1] without verifying words.Length > 1 - can this cause an index out of bounds exception when words.Length == 1, creating a DOS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: CheckSymbolIdentifier()] [Identifier Confusion] Can an attacker create a token symbol that legitimately contains the all-symbol identifier as part of its name, causing this function to incorrectly classify it as an all-symbol reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: CheckSymbolIdentifier()] [Case Sensitivity] Is the Equals comparison case-sensitive? Can an attacker bypass checks by using different casing of the all-symbol identifier? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: IsInWhiteList()] [Whitelist Query] Can an attacker enumerate all addresses in the lock whitelist for a given symbol by systematically querying IsInWhiteList, potentially identifying privileged addresses to target? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: IsInWhiteList()] [Default Behavior] If State.LockWhiteLists[input.Symbol][input.Address] is uninitialized, does it return false? Can this hide whitelist corruption or cause legitimate whitelisted addresses to be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: IsInWhiteList()] [Symbol Validation] Is there validation that input.Symbol exists as a valid token? Can an attacker query whitelist status for non-existent tokens to probe contract state? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetLockedAmount()] [Lock ID Validation] The function asserts LockId != null but doesn't validate its contents - can an attacker provide a malicious LockId that computes to a different virtual address than intended, exposing someone else's locked funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetLockedAmount()] [Virtual Address Collision] Can an attacker craft Address and LockId inputs that collide with another user's virtual address hash, allowing them to query (and potentially unlock) someone else's locked tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetLockedAmount()] [Symbol Injection] Can an attacker provide any arbitrary symbol to query locked amounts, including symbols that should not be lockable or that have special permissions, potentially exposing restricted balance information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetLockedAmount()] [Balance Query] The function calls GetBalance(virtualAddress, input.Symbol) - can this expose locked balances that should be hidden from view, or query balances in a way that bypasses access controls? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetVirtualAddressForLocking()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker find collisions in HashHelper.ComputeFrom(Context.Sender.Value.Concat(input.Address.Value).Concat(input.LockId.Value)) to generate the same virtual address as another user's lock, enabling theft of locked funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetVirtualAddressForLocking()] [Sender Dependency] The virtual address includes Context.Sender - can an attacker call this through a proxy or delegatecall to change Context.Sender and compute virtual addresses for locks they shouldn't access? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetVirtualAddressForLocking()] [Address Reuse] If the same Address and LockId are used by different Senders, do they map to different virtual addresses? Can an attacker exploit this to create confusion about lock ownership? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetVirtualAddressForLocking()] [Input Validation] Is there validation that input.Address is not null or zero? Can providing invalid addresses cause the hash computation to produce predictable or exploitable virtual addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCrossChainTransferTokenContractAddress()] [Cross-Chain Security] Can an attacker query the whitelist for any ChainId, including chains that don't exist or are malicious, to probe which chains are trusted for cross-chain transfers? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCrossChainTransferTokenContractAddress()] [Null Return] If State.CrossChainTransferWhiteList[input.ChainId] is null/uninitialized, does this function return null or a zero address? Can this cause cross-chain transfers to proceed to invalid addresses? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCrossChainTransferTokenContractAddress()] [Whitelist Bypass] Can an attacker register a malicious ChainId in the whitelist through governance manipulation, then use this function to legitimize cross-chain transfers to attacker-controlled chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetPrimaryTokenSymbol()] [Fallback Logic] The function falls back to Context.Variables.NativeSymbol if both _primaryTokenSymbol and State.ChainPrimaryTokenSymbol.Value are null - can this fallback be exploited to return an unexpected or manipulated symbol? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetPrimaryTokenSymbol()] [State Inconsistency] Can _primaryTokenSymbol (cached) and State.ChainPrimaryTokenSymbol.Value (persistent) become desynchronized, causing different results depending on when this function is called within a transaction? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetPrimaryTokenSymbol()] [Governance Attack] Can a malicious governance proposal change State.ChainPrimaryTokenSymbol.Value to point to an attacker-controlled token, causing all primary token operations to use the wrong token and potentially draining legitimate funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetPrimaryTokenSymbol()] [Empty String] Can string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace check pass but still return an empty or whitespace-only symbol from State, causing downstream operations to fail or behave unexpectedly? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCalculateFeeCoefficientsForContract()] [Fee Calculation] If input.Value is FeeTypeEnum.Tx, the function returns an empty CalculateFeeCoefficients - can this cause fee calculations to fail or default to zero, enabling free transactions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCalculateFeeCoefficientsForContract()] [FirstOrDefault] Using FirstOrDefault means null is returned if no matching coefficient exists - can this cause null reference exceptions in fee calculation logic, creating a DOS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCalculateFeeCoefficientsForContract()] [Fee Type Manipulation] Can an attacker provide an arbitrary FeeTypeEnum value that's not in the coefficient list to get zero fees, or provide a FeeType that has lower coefficients to underpay transaction fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_Views.cs] [Function: GetCalculateFeeCoefficientsForContract()] [State Corruption] If State.AllCalculateFeeCoefficients.Value.Value is null or empty, does this function fail gracefully or cause all fee queries to return null/empty coefficients? (Medium)"
