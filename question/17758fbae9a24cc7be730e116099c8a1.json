  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainReferenceState.cs] [Class: CrossChainContractState] [Partial Class Risk] Since this is a partial class, could other partial class files introduce properties or methods that bypass the reference-based security model by directly accessing contract addresses? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainReferenceState.cs] [Class: CrossChainContractState] [Reference Validation] Is there validation logic elsewhere that ensures all reference properties point to legitimate, non-malicious contract implementations before any cross-chain operations execute? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainReferenceState.cs] [Architecture] [Single Point of Failure] Do all cross-chain operations depend on these five reference properties, creating a single point of failure if any reference is compromised? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainReferenceState.cs] [Architecture] [Immutability] Are these reference properties effectively immutable after initialization, or could contract upgrades or admin functions modify them to redirect cross-chain trust assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainReferenceState.cs] [Architecture] [State Persistence] Are these reference properties persisted in contract state or re-initialized on every transaction, potentially exposing them to manipulation or desynchronization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainReferenceState.cs] [Architecture] [Access Control Pattern] Does the contract follow a consistent pattern for when to use each reference (e.g., always use ParliamentContract for governance, AssociationContract for multi-sig), or could confusion lead to using wrong references for security-critical operations? (Low)"
