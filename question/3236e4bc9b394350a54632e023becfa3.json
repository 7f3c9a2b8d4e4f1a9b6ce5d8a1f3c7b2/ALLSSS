  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousMinerList()] [State Consistency] If TryToGetTermNumber returns termNumber=1, does returning empty MinerList() instead of genesis miner list cause inconsistency in term transition logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousMinerList()] [Information Disclosure] Does exposing previous term miners allow attackers to identify which miners were removed/replaced and target them with social engineering? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetNextMinerPubkey()] [Time Manipulation] If attacker queries this right before their time slot and delays the response, can they gain unfair advantage by knowing they're next and pre-positioning attack?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetNextMinerPubkey()] [Consensus Gaming] Does exposing next miner pubkey allow current miner to selectively withhold blocks if next miner is a competitor, disrupting consensus? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetNextMinerPubkey()] [State Consistency] If round information updates between TryToGetCurrentRoundInformation and the LINQ query, can this return miner from wrong round? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: IsCurrentMiner(Address)] [Authorization Bypass] Can attacker craft Address that converts to null pubkey via ConvertAddressToPubkey, causing IsCurrentMiner(string) to return false but allowing block production bypass? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: IsCurrentMiner(Address)] [Address Collision] If two different addresses convert to same pubkey due to conversion logic flaw, can both addresses mine during same time slot causing double-mining? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: IsCurrentMiner(Address)] [DOS Vector] Can passing invalid Address format cause ConvertAddressToPubkey to throw unhandled exception, crashing consensus validation? (High)",
