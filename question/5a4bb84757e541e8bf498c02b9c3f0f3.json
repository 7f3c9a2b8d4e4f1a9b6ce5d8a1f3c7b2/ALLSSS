  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Integration] [Contract Upgrade] If the TokenContract is upgraded, does the method fee configuration persist, or could it be reset during upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Storage Bloat] Can an attacker with temporary controller access set fees for all possible method names to bloat contract storage permanently? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Gas Exhaustion] If SetMethodFee() is called with hundreds of fee tokens in input.Fees, can the validation loop exhaust gas and prevent legitimate fee updates? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Controller Lock] Can the controller be changed to an organization that's impossible to reach consensus in, permanently locking method fee configuration? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Invalid Token Loop] Can GetTransactionFeeSymbols() enter an infinite loop or exhaust gas if State.TransactionFees[methodName].Fees contains circular references? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Privilege Escalation] [Controller Hijack] If an attacker gains control of the Parliament default organization temporarily, can they change the method fee controller to a permanent attacker-controlled organization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Privilege Escalation] [Organization Creation] Can an attacker create a malicious organization with ValidateOrganizationExist that always returns true, then use it to gain controller access? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Privilege Escalation] [Default Authority Abuse] During the initialization window when State.MethodFeeController.Value is null, can any sender act as controller? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Fee-Free Methods] The hardcoded list of fee-free methods includes ChargeTransactionFees and ChargeResourceToken - does this create a logical inconsistency where fee-charging methods don't pay fees? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Size Fee Logic] In GetTransactionFeeSymbols(), if IsSizeFeeFree=true, size fee symbols are not added - but should size fees apply to these methods regardless? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Token Burnability] Why is IsBurnable required for fee tokens - is this because fees are burned, and if so, what prevents setting fees in a burnable token that's then made non-burnable? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Multiple Fee Tokens] Can a method have fees in multiple tokens simultaneously, and if so, how is the choice of which token to pay determined by users? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Business Logic] [Zero Basic Fee] If BasicFee=0 is explicitly set (vs not set), does this mean the method is free or should size fees still apply? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Code Pattern] [String Comparison] The Contains() check in GetMethodFee() for fee-free methods uses string comparison - is this gas-efficient and safe from Unicode/encoding attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Code Pattern] [Null Propagation] Multiple null checks are performed (State.TransactionFees[methodName] != null, State.SymbolListToPayTxSizeFee.Value == null) - are all null cases handled correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Code Pattern] [State Access Pattern] Direct state access without caching (e.g., State.MethodFeeController.Value accessed multiple times) - can this cause gas inefficiency or inconsistency? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Code Pattern] [Loop Invariant] In GetTransactionFeeSymbols(), symbols.Contains() is called in loops - does this create O(n²) complexity that could cause DOS with many fee tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Data Integrity] [AuthorityInfo Storage] State.MethodFeeController.Value stores AuthorityInfo directly - is there any signature verification to ensure this data hasn't been tampered with? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Data Integrity] [MethodFees Serialization] State.TransactionFees stores MethodFees objects - are there any hash checks to verify the integrity of stored fee configurations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Governance] [Proposal Bypass] Can an attacker create a scenario where ChangeMethodFeeController() is called directly without going through a proper governance proposal? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Governance] [Time-Delay Attack] Is there any time-delay or grace period between ChangeMethodFeeController() execution and when the new controller takes effect, allowing for emergency response? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Governance] [Multi-Sig Bypass] If the controller is an Association (multi-sig), can the threshold be manipulated through ValidateOrganizationExist to require fewer signatures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Monitoring] [Event Emission] Are events emitted when SetMethodFee() or ChangeMethodFeeController() are called, allowing off-chain monitoring of governance actions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Testing] [Edge Case Coverage] Has the empty controller scenario (Parliament not deployed) been tested, and are there unit tests for all authorization branches? (Low)",
