  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Invariant: Miner Uniqueness] Are there checks that tuneOrderInformation at line 44 doesn't assign multiple miners the same FinalOrderOfNextRound, causing order conflicts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Invariant: Timestamp Monotonicity] Should ActualMiningTimes at line 42 be validated for monotonically increasing timestamps to prevent time-travel attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Invariant: ProducedBlocks Non-Negative] Is there validation that ProducedBlocks at line 41 cannot be negative, which would indicate state corruption or integer underflow? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Side-Channel Timing] Does the execution time of LINQ queries at lines 22-33 vary based on miner count or dictionary sizes, potentially leaking information through timing analysis? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Memory Safety] Are there bounds on EncryptedPieces and DecryptedPieces dictionary sizes to prevent memory exhaustion attacks via excessively large byte arrays? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Determinism] Does the ToDictionary operation at lines 24, 28, and 32 produce deterministic ordering, or could non-deterministic dictionary iteration cause consensus divergence across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Gas Optimization] Could the three separate LINQ Where operations at lines 22, 26, and 30 be combined into a single iteration over RealTimeMinersInformation.Values for gas efficiency? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus.cs] [Function: ExtractInformationToUpdateConsensus()] [Error Propagation] If ToDictionary encounters duplicate keys at lines 24, 28, or 32, will the ArgumentException propagate with sufficient context for debugging?
