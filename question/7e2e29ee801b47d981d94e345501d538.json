  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [State Access] [State Read Side Effects] Functions like GetPrimaryTokenSymbol() and GetTransactionFeeSymbols() read state during path calculation - if these have side effects, could repeated path calculations cause state corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [State Access] [Cache Inconsistency] If state values read during path calculation are cached and reused, but state changes between reads, could this cause inconsistent path declarations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [State Access] [Concurrent State Modification] If State.TransactionFeeFreeAllowancesSymbolList or delegation maps are modified during path calculation, could this cause partial or incorrect path sets? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Conflict Detection] [Same Address Transfer] If txn.From equals args.To in Transfer, both WritePaths point to same balance - does the conflict detector recognize this as a conflict with other parallel transactions to that address? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Conflict Detection] [Path Equality Logic] WritePaths.Contains(path) check depends on ScopedStatePath equality - if equality is reference-based not value-based, could identical paths be treated as different? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Conflict Detection] [ReadPath vs WritePath] Some state is in ReadPaths but not WritePaths - does the conflict detector allow write-write conflicts but prevent read-write conflicts, and is this the correct model? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Conflict Detection] [Transitive Conflicts] If transaction A writes path X, transaction B writes path Y, and both are related (e.g., allowance and balance), but not explicitly conflicting, could this cause state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Method Routing] [Case Sensitivity] The switch statement matches txn.MethodName using nameof() - if method names are case-sensitive and attacker controls casing, could this bypass specific path declarations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Method Routing] [Method Name Spoofing] If an attacker can craft a transaction with MethodName that matches nameof(Transfer) but different Params structure, could this cause parser errors or incorrect path calculations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Method Routing] [Missing Method Handlers] Only Transfer and TransferFrom are handled - if other methods like Approve, Burn, Mint exist but return NonParallelizable, is this a performance issue or security issue? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Method Routing] [Future Method Addition] If new transfer-like methods are added to the contract but not added to this switch statement, will they incorrectly default to NonParallelizable causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Lock Handling] [LockWhiteLists Write Path] TransferFrom includes LockWhiteLists in WritePaths using txn.From - if lock checks involve the token owner (args.From), could missing owner's lock paths cause race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Lock Handling] [Lock State Reads] Lock state is written but not declared in ReadPaths - if lock checks read lock state of related addresses (e.g., global lock status), could missing read paths cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Lock Handling] [Whitelist Bypass] If LockWhiteLists path is only added for TransferFrom but not Transfer, could attackers bypass lock restrictions by using Transfer instead of TransferFrom? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Address Handling] [Address.ToString() Consistency] Multiple places use .ToString() on addresses - if ToString() can produce different representations for the same address, could this cause path mismatches? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Address Handling] [Address.ToBase58() Uniqueness] AddPathForTransactionFeeFreeAllowance uses ToBase58() - if base58 encoding is not bijective, could different addresses map to same base58 string causing path collisions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Address Handling] [Address.FromBase58() Validation] AddPathForDelegatees calls Address.FromBase58() on stored strings - if these strings are corrupted or tampered, could this throw exceptions during path calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Address Handling] [Null Address Handling] If txn.From, txn.To, args.From, or args.To is null address, does path construction handle this gracefully or could it cause null reference exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Collection Handling] [WritePaths Collection Modification] Multiple functions add to resourceInfo.WritePaths - if WritePaths is not thread-safe and multiple threads call these functions, could race conditions corrupt the collection? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Collection Handling] [Distinct() Timing] AddPathForDelegatees calls delegateeList.Distinct() at the end - if delegate addresses are added multiple times before this, could excessive duplicates cause performance issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Collection Handling] [AddRange Performance] secondDelegateeList is populated then added to delegateeList using AddRange - if delegation chains are very large, could this cause memory or performance issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Collection Handling] [Keys.ToList() Immutability] GetDelegateeList calls Delegatees.Keys.ToList() - if the Keys collection changes during iteration, could this cause exceptions or incomplete lists? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Primary Token] [Primary Token Cache] AddPathForTransactionFee checks if _primaryTokenSymbol != string.Empty - if this field is cached but stale, could outdated primary token cause missing fee paths? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Primary Token] [GetPrimaryTokenSymbol Call] GetPrimaryTokenSymbol(new Empty()) is called during path calculation - if this makes external contract calls, could reentrancy or timing issues affect path calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS2_StatePathsProvider.cs] [Primary Token] [Symbol Duplication] Primary token is added 'if not already in symbols' - but if GetTransactionFeeSymbols already includes it with different casing, could this cause duplicate paths? (Low)"
