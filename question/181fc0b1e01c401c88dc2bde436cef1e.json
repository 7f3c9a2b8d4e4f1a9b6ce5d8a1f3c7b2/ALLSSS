  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker front-run the ChangeMethodFeeController transaction to set malicious fees before the controller change takes effect, given that SetMethodFee checks Context.Sender against State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress at line 16 but the controller might be updated in a pending transaction? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Authorization Bypass] Can RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() at line 14 initialize a default controller that differs from the expected Parliament address if GetParliamentDefaultAddress() returns an incorrect or manipulated address, allowing unauthorized fee updates? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker exploit reentrancy during the AssertValidToken call at line 13, which makes external calls to State.TokenContract, to modify State.MethodFeeController.Value before the authorization check at line 16 executes?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker set input.Fees to an empty list to bypass the AssertValidToken validation loop at line 13 and set a MethodFees entry with no fees, allowing free execution of that method? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker pass extremely large methodFee.BasicFee values that pass the >= 0 check at line 76 in AssertValidToken but cause integer overflow when fees are later calculated or collected?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker who controls the MethodFeeController set astronomically high fees via SetMethodFee at line 17 to make all Election contract methods economically unusable, effectively freezing governance operations? (Critical)",

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Logic Flaw] Can an attacker set fees for non-existent or future methods via input.MethodName, and when those methods are later added, will they automatically use these pre-configured fees without proper validation?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [State Corruption] If input.Fees contains duplicate symbols, does the validation loop at line 13 check each duplicate, and can this cause inconsistent state or allow an attacker to set conflicting fee amounts for the same token?
