  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: VerifyTransaction()] [Null Merkle Root] If GetMerkleTreeRoot returns null for an indexed but corrupted parent chain height, does the Assert message correctly indicate the issue, or can it mask state corruption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: VerifyTransaction()] [TransactionId Collision] If input.TransactionId collides with another transaction's ID (due to weak ID generation), can both transactions verify against the same merkle proof? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: VerifyTransaction()] [Parent Chain Reorganization] Does verification account for parent chain reorgs where a previously valid merkle root at height H becomes invalid after a reorg? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: VerifyTransaction()] [Boolean Return Tampering] Can the BoolValue return be intercepted or modified in transit by malicious contracts calling this view function, changing false to true? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainStatus()] [Missing Input Validation] Can an attacker query with input.Value = 0 or negative chain IDs to bypass the null check and retrieve unintended chain status information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainStatus()] [State Consistency] If State.SideChainInfo[input.Value] is null but the chain was previously created, does the Assert on line 51 hide chain existence, or can null checks fail during chain lifecycle transitions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainStatus()] [Status Transition Race] Can querying status during a chain status transition (e.g., Active -> Terminated) return inconsistent or intermediate status values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainStatus()] [Information Disclosure] Does revealing SideChainStatus to anyone allow attackers to discover terminated chains and attempt to exploit them before proper cleanup? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainStatus()] [Invalid Chain ID] Can querying a parent chain ID instead of side chain ID cause incorrect status retrieval or bypass side-chain-specific validations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetChainStatus()] [DOS via Invalid IDs] Can spamming queries with non-existent chain IDs cause repeated Assert failures and waste gas for monitoring systems? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainHeight()] [Height Manipulation] If State.CurrentSideChainHeight returns stale or unupdated height values, can this cause cross-chain indexing to accept outdated or unverified side chain blocks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainHeight()] [Integer Overflow] Can the height value overflow Int64 for extremely long-running side chains, causing height to wrap to negative or zero, breaking indexing logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainHeight()] [Zero Height Ambiguity] If a side chain is newly created and CurrentSideChainHeight is 0, does returning 0 distinguish between 'not indexed yet' versus 'genesis block indexed'? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainHeight()] [State Desync] Can State.SideChainInfo exist for a chain but State.CurrentSideChainHeight be uninitialized (default 0), causing incorrect height reporting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainHeight()] [Terminated Chain Query] Does this function allow querying heights for terminated side chains, potentially allowing operations on chains that should be inactive? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetSideChainHeight()] [Height Rollback] If parent chain reorgs cause side chain height to be rolled back, does this function reflect the rollback, or can it return future heights that are no longer valid? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetParentChainHeight()] [Parent Chain Existence] If State.ParentChainId is 0 (main chain), does the Assert on line 66 properly prevent queries, or can default values bypass the check? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetParentChainHeight()] [Height Staleness] If State.CurrentParentChainHeight is not updated frequently, can stale parent heights cause child chain to miss critical parent chain events or merkle root updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetParentChainHeight()] [Zero Height Default] If parent chain exists but CurrentParentChainHeight is uninitialized (0), does returning 0 violate the parent chain height invariant? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_View.cs] [Function: GetParentChainHeight()] [Indexing Lag] Does the returned height guarantee that all blocks up to that height have been fully indexed and verified, or can it return heights with pending indexing? (High)",
