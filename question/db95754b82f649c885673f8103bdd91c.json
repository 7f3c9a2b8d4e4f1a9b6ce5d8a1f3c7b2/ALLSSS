  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Default Org Manipulation] In GetDefaultParliamentController, the method trusts State.ParliamentContract.GetDefaultOrganizationAddress.Call(new Empty()) to return the correct parliament organization address. If the ParliamentContract reference is compromised, can it return an arbitrary address that the attacker controls, making them the de facto parliament and giving them control over all MultiToken governance? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractReferenceState.cs] [All Properties] [Error Handling Bypass] If cross-contract calls via these references fail (network issues, gas limits, contract bugs) and exceptions are not properly caught and handled, can failed authorization checks or controller creations leave the MultiToken contract in an inconsistent state where no valid controller exists, permanently locking governance capabilities? (High)"
