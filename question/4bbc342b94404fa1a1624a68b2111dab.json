  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [Gas Manipulation] Each iteration calls GetCandidateVote which is another view function - can an attacker craft candidates with expensive vote lookups to DOS pagination? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [Data Consistency] Between reading candidates list and calling GetCandidateVote, votes could change - can this show inconsistent candidate details? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVote()] [Data Integrity] Returns a new CandidateVote with only Pubkey set if state lookup fails - can consuming contracts misinterpret this as a valid candidate with zero votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVote()] [Input Validation] ByteStringHelper.FromHexString(input.Value) could throw on invalid hex - is there validation before this call? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithRecords()] [Null Return] If votes == null, it returns new CandidateVote() without any data - can this confuse callers expecting at least the pubkey? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithRecords()] [Index Out of Bounds] The index++ pattern with ObtainedActiveVotingRecordIds matching obtainedRecords - if VoteContract returns different count, can this crash? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithRecords()] [DOS Attack] If ObtainedActiveVotingRecordIds contains thousands of IDs, can the GetVotingRecords call and iteration exhaust gas limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithAllRecords()] [Logic Error] Calls GetCandidateVoteWithRecords first, then adds withdrawn records - if the first call modifies shared state, can this cause double-counting? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithAllRecords()] [Index Out of Bounds] Same index++ pattern with ObtainedWithdrawnVotingRecordIds and obtainedWithdrawnRecords - can count mismatches cause crashes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithAllRecords()] [DOS Attack] Combined active + withdrawn records could create massive response datasets - is there size limiting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord()] [Logic Error] GetNewestPubkey(votingRecord.Option) could return null or different pubkey - is there validation that this matches expected candidate? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord()] [State Lookup] State.LockTimeMap[voteId] is accessed without null check - can missing lock time data cause exceptions or default to zero? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord()] [Timestamp Overflow] votingRecord.VoteTimestamp.AddSeconds(lockSeconds) - if lockSeconds is Int64.MaxValue or very large, can this overflow Timestamp? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord()] [Logic Error] Weight is calculated via GetVotesWeight(votingRecord.Amount, lockSeconds) - if lock time is from State but amount is from votingRecord, can they be inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord()] [Data Consistency] If votingRecord.Option (original candidate) differs significantly from GetNewestPubkey result, can this misattribute votes after candidate replacement? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Logic Error] If latestSnapshot is null or ElectionResult is empty, alternativeCandidates remains empty - can this allow evil miners to continue if there are valid candidates available? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [DOS Attack] The Where().OrderByDescending().ToList() chain on ElectionResult - if snapshot has thousands of candidates, can this exhaust gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Logic Error] Initial miners are excluded via ByteString comparison, but if State.InitialMiners contains stale or duplicated entries, can this fail to properly exclude them? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Integer Overflow] Math.Min(evilMinersPubKeys.Count, maybeNextCandidates.Count) - if counts are manipulated to be negative, can this cause unexpected behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Logic Error] When diff > 0 and adding initial miners, it filters by !State.BannedPubkeyMap[k] - but what if all initial miners are banned? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Race Condition] Between identifying evilMinersPubKeys and selecting alternativeCandidates, can candidates be banned or unbanned, causing mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Logic Error] The Take(takeAmount) on selectedInitialMiners - if takeAmount exceeds available unbanned initial miners, can this return fewer alternatives than needed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Data Integrity] If input.CurrentMinerList contains duplicates or invalid pubkeys, can this affect evil miner detection accuracy? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetEvilMinersPubkeys()] [Logic Error] Simply checks State.BannedPubkeyMap[p] for each miner - if banned status is not updated timely, can evil miners evade detection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetEvilMinersPubkeys()] [DOS Attack] If currentMinerList is extremely large, the Where().ToList() could consume excessive gas - is there a miner count limit? (Low)"
