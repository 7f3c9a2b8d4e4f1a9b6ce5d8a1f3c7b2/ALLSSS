  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Trust Boundary: ExtraData Source] [Untrusted Input] ExtraData comes from block header which is attacker-controlled - are there any direct uses of ExtraData fields without validation that could exploit trust assumptions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Trust Boundary: StateDb Data] [State Poisoning] If an attacker can poison StateDb (via earlier block execution), can corrupted BaseRound/PreviousRound/LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount break all future validations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Validation Order: Context Creation Before Provider Chain] [Initialization Issue] Is ConsensusValidationContext fully initialized before being passed to validation providers, or can providers see partially initialized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Validation Order: RecoverFromUpdateValue/TinyBlock Timing] [State Consistency] BaseRound is modified by RecoverFromUpdateValue/RecoverFromTinyBlock before context creation - can this cause mismatch between BaseRound and CurrentRoundNumber/CurrentTermNumber?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Property Relationship: BaseRound vs ProvidedRound Miners] [Miner Set Mismatch] Can ProvidedRound contain miners not in BaseRound, or vice versa, breaking assumptions about miner continuity between rounds?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Edge Case: Genesis Block] [Initialization] During genesis block validation, can BaseRound/PreviousRound be uninitialized or have special values that break validation provider assumptions?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Edge Case: Single Miner Network] [Special Handling] When BaseRound.RealTimeMinersInformation.Count == 1, can validation providers that check mining order or time slots make incorrect decisions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Edge Case: Term Transition] [State Transition] During term transition blocks, can mismatched CurrentTermNumber/BaseRound.TermNumber/PreviousRound.TermNumber cause validation failures or bypasses?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Edge Case: First Round of Term] [Validation Skip] When CurrentRoundNumber == 1 and PreviousRound.TermNumber != CurrentTermNumber, can critical validations be inappropriately skipped? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Edge Case: Tiny Blocks] [Continuous Blocks] When a miner produces multiple tiny blocks rapidly, can LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount updates lag, failing to prevent excessive continuous blocks?

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ConsensusValidationContext.cs] [Data Type: Round Object Complexity] [Validation Completeness] Round objects contain complex nested data (RealTimeMinersInformation with many fields) - can partial validation miss manipulated fields?
