  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: Initialized] [Re-initialization Attack] If the Initialized singleton state can be reset to false after initial setup, can an attacker re-initialize the contract with malicious parameters, overwriting TokenContract, ElectionContract, and MethodFeeController with attacker-controlled addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: MethodFeeController] [Authority Bypass] If MethodFeeController.Value can be updated without proper authorization checks in implementation, can an attacker set themselves as the fee controller and manipulate TransactionFees mappings to drain user funds or disable fee collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: Initialized] [Logic Error] If the implementation checks Initialized.Value before critical operations but doesn't validate it's set correctly, can an attacker exploit a scenario where Initialized is true but contract references (TokenContract, ProfitContract) remain uninitialized, causing null reference exceptions or state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: MethodFeeController] [Authority Info Manipulation] If MethodFeeController stores an AuthorityInfo with contract address and owner address, can an attacker exploit missing validation to set a MethodFeeController pointing to a malicious contract that always returns true for authorization, bypassing all fee management controls? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TokenContract] [Contract Reference Hijacking] If TokenContract reference state can be modified after initialization without proper access control, can an attacker replace it with a malicious token contract that reports false balances, enabling unlimited fee payments or breaking economic invariants? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TokenConverterContract] [Reference Substitution] Can an attacker exploit missing initialization checks to set TokenConverterContract to a malicious converter that manipulates token prices, allowing them to buy tokens at artificially low prices or sell at inflated rates, draining reserves? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: ElectionContract] [Governance Bypass] If ElectionContract reference can be changed to point to an attacker-controlled contract, can they manipulate election results, validator sets, or consensus mechanisms by returning fake election data when the Economic contract queries miner information? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: ProfitContract] [Profit Distribution Attack] If ProfitContract reference lacks integrity checks, can an attacker set it to a malicious contract that redirects all profit distributions to their address instead of legitimate Treasury or dividend recipients? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: ParliamentContract] [Authorization Chain Break] If ParliamentContract reference is corrupted, can governance proposals bypass proper voting by querying a fake parliament contract that always approves proposals, enabling unauthorized economic parameter changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: ZeroContract] [Genesis Contract Manipulation] If ZeroContract (ACS0 genesis) reference can be altered, can an attacker bypass deployment authorization checks, deploy malicious contracts, or manipulate contract addresses used throughout the economic system? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Fee Mapping Corruption] If TransactionFees mapped state lacks proper initialization, can an attacker query uninitialized method names to get null MethodFees, causing the implementation to skip fee charging entirely and enabling free transactions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Unauthorized Fee Modification] If TransactionFees mappings can be updated without MethodFeeController authorization check, can an attacker set transaction fees for critical methods to zero, breaking economic security model and enabling spam attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Fee Overflow Attack] If MethodFees stored in TransactionFees use unbounded integers without validation, can an attacker set fees to max int64 value, causing overflow when calculating total fees and resulting in negative fee amounts or zero fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Key Collision Exploit] If TransactionFees uses method names as string keys without normalization, can an attacker register fees under alternative representations (uppercase, whitespace, Unicode variants) to bypass fee checks for protected methods? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Mapping Exhaustion DOS] If TransactionFees MappedState has no size limits, can an attacker register fees for thousands of fake method names to exhaust storage, causing out-of-gas errors when legitimate users try to set or query transaction fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TokenContract (internal)] [Visibility Constraint Bypass] Despite TokenContract being marked internal, if the implementation exposes getter methods without access control, can external attackers query the contract reference address and directly call it, bypassing Economic contract's fee collection or validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: All References (internal)] [Cross-Contract Call Attack] If internal contract references lack call authentication, can an attacker craft transactions that appear to come from Economic contract's address when calling TokenContract, ElectionContract, or ProfitContract, bypassing those contracts' authorization checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: MappedState<string, MethodFees>] [State Corruption via Empty Key] If TransactionFees.MappedState allows empty string as key, can an attacker register a default fee under empty key that gets applied to all methods when proper method name lookup fails, effectively setting a global fee? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: SingletonState<bool> Initialized] [Boolean State Manipulation] If Initialized uses default bool behavior, can the state be undefined initially (not explicitly false), causing inconsistent behavior where uninitialized checks pass but initialization hasn't actually occurred? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: SingletonState<AuthorityInfo>] [Null Authority DOS] If MethodFeeController.Value can be set to null, will fee management operations that dereference it crash, effectively freezing all transaction fee updates and economic governance? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [Cross-State: Initialized + Contract References] [Partial Initialization Exploit] Can an attacker exploit a race condition where Initialized is set to true but only some contract references (TokenContract, ElectionContract) are set, leaving others (ProfitContract, ParliamentContract) uninitialized, causing selective failures in economic operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [Cross-State: MethodFeeController + TransactionFees] [Authority-Fee Desync] If MethodFeeController is updated but existing TransactionFees entries aren't migrated or invalidated, can the old authority's fee configurations persist, allowing them to continue controlling fees even after authority transfer? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TokenContract + TokenConverterContract] [Circular Dependency Attack] If TokenContract and TokenConverterContract references point to contracts that call back into Economic contract, can an attacker trigger reentrancy through state reads, causing the Economic contract to operate on stale or inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [All States] [Upgrade Path Vulnerability] If the contract undergoes an upgrade, are all state variables (Initialized, MethodFeeController, TransactionFees, contract references) properly preserved or migrated? Can an upgrade reset critical states, requiring re-initialization that an attacker could front-run? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees Migration] [Fee History Manipulation] If TransactionFees mappings are migrated during upgrade, can an attacker exploit the migration window to inject malicious fee entries or remove legitimate ones, corrupting the fee schedule? (High)"
