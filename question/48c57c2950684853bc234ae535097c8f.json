  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker cause excessive gas consumption by providing an unbounded array of IDs in input.Ids, iterating through thousands of state reads via Select(), potentially causing transaction timeout or blockchain congestion? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [DOS Attack] If input.Ids contains millions of duplicate hash values, does the AddRange() operation on line 11 consume excessive memory and processing time, creating a denial-of-service vector against view call infrastructure? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Information Leakage] Does the method returning null VotingRecords in the collection (when State.VotingRecords[id] is null) leak information about which vote IDs exist versus non-existent IDs, enabling enumeration attacks to discover valid voting records? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Input Validation] Is there any maximum limit on input.Ids.Count to prevent attackers from requesting batch retrieval of an arbitrarily large number of records, causing resource exhaustion on nodes serving this view method? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [State Consistency] If voting records are being updated concurrently via Vote() or Withdraw() while GetVotingRecords() executes, can this create an inconsistent snapshot where some records reflect pre-update state and others reflect post-update state? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Data Integrity] When returning null records for non-existent IDs, does the calling contract or client code properly handle null values in the Records collection, or could this cause null pointer exceptions in downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Privacy Leak] Can an attacker batch-query all possible hash combinations to enumerate all existing voting records in the system, violating voter privacy if voting records contain sensitive information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Gas Economics] Does the Select() operation on line 11 charge gas proportional to input.Ids.Count, and if not, can this be exploited to perform expensive state reads at minimal cost? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Privacy Violation] Can any caller query any address's voting history via State.VotedItemsMap[input] without access control, enabling surveillance of all users' voting behaviors including active and withdrawn votes across all voting items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Information Leakage] Does returning 'new VotedItems()' on line 17 when State.VotedItemsMap[input] is null distinguish between addresses that have never voted versus addresses that voted but withdrew all votes, leaking information about user participation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Data Integrity] If the VotedItemsMap contains corrupted data (e.g., vote IDs in both ActiveVotes and WithdrawnVotes lists), does this method expose the corruption, or could it hide inconsistencies that indicate state manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Enumeration Attack] Can an attacker systematically query all possible addresses to build a complete database of all voters and their voting patterns, violating system-wide privacy assumptions about anonymous voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [State Consistency] If UpdateVotedItems() (line 146-161 in VoteContract.cs) is executing concurrently with this view method, can a race condition cause GetVotedItems() to return stale or partially-updated voting data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Enumeration Attack] Does the Assert on line 23 throwing 'Voting record not found' for invalid hashes enable attackers to efficiently enumerate all valid vote IDs by observing which inputs succeed versus fail, facilitating targeted attacks on specific votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Information Leakage] Can the difference in response (assertion failure vs. successful return) be used to determine if a vote ID exists, enabling attackers to probe for specific voting records without authorization? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Access Control] Should there be authorization checks preventing arbitrary callers from reading sensitive voting record details (voter address, amount, option) that might be intended as private information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Data Exposure] Does returning the full VotingRecord object (including voter address, amount, option, timestamps) expose too much information that could be used to identify voters or correlate voting patterns across multiple voting items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [State Manipulation Detection] If State.VotingRecords[input] has been maliciously modified (e.g., IsWithdrawn flag flipped), does this view method return the corrupted state without validation, hiding potential state manipulation attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Null Reference] The assertion on line 23 checks 'votingRecord != null', but is this sufficient if State.VotingRecords can return a non-null but uninitialized/default VotingRecord object that passes the null check but contains invalid data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Enumeration Attack] Does the Assert on line 30 enable enumeration of valid voting item IDs by trying different hash values and observing which ones succeed versus throw 'Voting item not found', facilitating targeted attacks on active voting items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Information Leakage] Can attackers determine which voting items exist and their current state (including sponsor, options, snapshot numbers) without authorization, potentially enabling manipulation strategies based on this reconnaissance? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Privacy Violation] Does exposing the sponsor address on line 31 (from VotingItem.Sponsor) violate privacy if voting item creators should be anonymous, enabling targeted harassment or coercion of sponsors? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Data Integrity] If State.VotingItems[input.VotingItemId] contains inconsistent data (e.g., CurrentSnapshotNumber > TotalSnapshotNumber), does this method expose the corruption without validation, hiding potential state manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Null Safety] Similar to GetVotingRecord, is the null check on line 30 sufficient, or could State.VotingItems return a non-null default object that passes the check but contains invalid/uninitialized data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Access Control] Should there be restrictions on who can query voting item details, especially if Options list or other fields contain sensitive configuration that could aid in gaming the voting system? (Low)"
