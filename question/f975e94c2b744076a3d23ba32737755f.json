  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Uninitialized Reference] Can uninitialized ParliamentContract reference lead to null reference exceptions when Association contract attempts to call Parliament methods during proposal authorization checks, causing DOS of governance operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Uninitialized Reference] Can uninitialized TokenContract reference cause transaction failures when Association contract attempts fee deduction or token transfers, enabling users to bypass fee payments? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Initialization Order] If ParliamentContract is accessed before initialization in contract deployment, can early callers exploit uninitialized state to bypass authorization checks?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Contract Substitution] Can an attacker with state modification privileges replace the ParliamentContract reference with a malicious contract that always returns 'authorized' for any proposal, bypassing all governance checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Contract Substitution] Can malicious modification of TokenContract reference point to a fake token contract that reports false balances or skips fee deductions, enabling free operations? (Critical)",

(Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Reference Hijacking] Can unauthorized modification of TokenContract reference during runtime redirect all token operations to an attacker-controlled contract that drains association funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Reentrancy] When Association calls ParliamentContract methods, can the Parliament contract perform reentrant callbacks before Association updates its state, leading to double-voting or duplicate proposal execution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Reentrancy] During token transfer callbacks via TokenContract, can malicious token implementations reenter Association contract to manipulate proposal states or voting counts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Cross-Contract Reentrancy] Can a sequence of Association -> Parliament -> Association calls create reentrancy loops that exhaust gas or create inconsistent states in proposal approvals?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Authorization Bypass] Can direct calls to ParliamentContract methods bypass Association's intended authorization logic if Association doesn't properly validate Parliament responses? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Authorization Bypass] Can attackers call TokenContract directly to transfer association-owned tokens, bypassing Association's multi-sig requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Privilege Escalation] If ParliamentContract reference allows calling privileged Parliament methods, can Association contract be exploited to gain unauthorized Parliament control? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Privilege Escalation] Can Association contract's TokenContract reference be abused to mint tokens if TokenContract doesn't properly restrict minting authority? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [State Synchronization] Can ParliamentContract state changes (like organization membership) become out-of-sync with Association's cached data, leading to authorization using stale information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [State Synchronization] If TokenContract balances change externally, can Association make decisions based on outdated balance information, enabling double-spending of voting power? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Consistency] Can concurrent modifications through both Association and Parliament contracts create race conditions in proposal states? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Consistency] Can simultaneous token operations through Association and direct TokenContract calls create inconsistent fee accounting? (High)",
