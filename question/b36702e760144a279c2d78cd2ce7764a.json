  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ProcessConsensusInformation.cs] [Function: ProcessNextRound() + ProcessNextTerm()] [Term-Round Desynchronization] If ProcessNextRound is called immediately after ProcessNextTerm, both updating round numbers, can the two updates race and cause round number to be set incorrectly, breaking all future consensus operations that depend on accurate round numbers? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ProcessConsensusInformation.cs] [Function: ProcessUpdateValue() + PerformSecretSharing()] [Secret Sharing Cryptographic Break] If miners don't verify that DecryptedPieces in PerformSecretSharing actually decrypt to valid shares, can a malicious miner submit garbage decrypted values that corrupt the shared secret, making future random numbers predictable? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ProcessConsensusInformation.cs] [Function: ProcessNextTerm() Treasury Integration] [Double Treasury Release] The check DonateMiningReward(previousRound) determines treasury release. If an attacker can manipulate previousRound state to make this return true multiple times during a single term transition (e.g., through reentrancy), can they trigger multiple Release calls and drain the treasury? (Critical)"
