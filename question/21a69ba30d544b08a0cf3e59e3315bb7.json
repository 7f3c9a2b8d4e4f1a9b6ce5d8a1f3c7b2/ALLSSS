  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Authorization Bypass] If the TokenContract reference is not properly initialized during contract deployment, could malicious actors exploit null reference exceptions or redirect token operations to unauthorized contracts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ProfitContract] [Contract Substitution] Could the ProfitContract reference be maliciously modified post-deployment to redirect profit distributions to an attacker-controlled contract, bypassing intended dividend mechanisms? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Governance Bypass] If ParliamentContract reference points to a compromised or malicious parliament implementation, could governance proposals be auto-approved without proper voting thresholds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Class: TokenHolderContractState] [Initialization] Are these contract references validated and frozen after initial deployment to prevent runtime substitution attacks via contract upgrade mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Cross-Contract Call] When invoking TokenContract methods, is the contract address cryptographically verified against expected system contract addresses to prevent impersonation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ProfitContract] [State Consistency] Could race conditions occur if ProfitContract reference is accessed concurrently during profit distribution and state updates, leading to inconsistent dividend calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Dependency Chain] If ParliamentContract is unavailable or returns malformed data, does the TokenHolder contract have proper fallback mechanisms or will it enter a denial-of-service state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/ContractsReferences.cs] [Internal Visibility] [Access Control] Since properties are marked internal, are there sufficient access controls in the broader TokenHolder implementation to prevent unauthorized direct manipulation of these references? (Medium)"
