  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Function: AddOptions()] [Batch Limit Bypass] At line 318, options are validated individually by AssertOption(), then added at line 319. Can total exceed MaximumOptionsCount by adding many options in single batch? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Function: AddOptions()] [Limit Check Timing] At lines 320-321, count check happens AFTER AddRange(). If adding options causes count to exceed 64, is revert guaranteed or can state be partially corrupted? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Function: AddOptions()] [Duplicate Within Batch] If input.Options contains duplicates within same batch, will AssertOption() at line 318 catch them, or only check against existing options? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Cross-Function: Withdraw() + UpdateVotingResult()] [Underflow in Results] If Withdraw() subtracts at line 216 but vote was never properly added due to bug, can Results[option] underflow? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [Cross-Function: Register() + TakeSnapshot()] [Immediate Snapshot Attack] Can sponsor register voting item and immediately take all snapshots before anyone votes, making voting item unusable? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContract.cs] [State: VotingRecords Mapping] At line 117, VotingRecords[VoteId] can be overwritten. Can attacker control VoteId generation to overwrite legitimate votes? (Critical)",
