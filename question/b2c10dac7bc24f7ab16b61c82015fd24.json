  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Function: GetSortedImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeights()] [Sort Algorithm Security] Does List.Sort() use a comparison-based sort that could be exploited if ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight values are attacker-controlled, potentially causing algorithmic complexity attacks or incorrect ordering? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Function: GetSortedImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeights()] [Return List Immutability] Should the returned list be immutable to prevent external modification? Could a malicious contract receive the list and modify it before it's used for LIB determination, corrupting consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Property: MinersCountOfConsent] [Thread Safety] If MinersCountOfConsent is accessed concurrently from multiple threads, and RealTimeMinersInformation is being modified, could race conditions cause inconsistent quorum values to be returned? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Function: GetSortedImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeights()] [Long.MaxValue Edge Case] If a miner reports ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight = long.MaxValue, could this dominate the sorted list and prevent meaningful LIB selection, effectively stalling finalization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Property: MinersCountOfConsent] [Minimum Threshold] For RealTimeMinersInformation.Count = 3, does MinersCountOfConsent correctly compute to 3 (3*2/3+1 = 2+1 = 3), requiring all three miners? Is this overly restrictive or does it correctly implement 2/3 majority? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Function: GetSortedImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeights()] [Select Projection] Could the Select(i => i.ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight) projection fail or throw if the property accessor itself has side effects or validation logic that rejects certain values? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight.cs] [Property: MinersCountOfConsent] [Mul(2) Before Div(3)] Does performing multiplication before division (Count.Mul(2).Div(3)) maintain precision better than Div(3) first, and could reversing the order create different quorum values due to integer rounding? (Medium)"
