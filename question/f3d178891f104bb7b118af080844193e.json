(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidFeeToken()] [Token Property] The check at line 131 requires tokenInfo.IsBurnable to be true - can an attacker create a token that reports IsBurnable as true but fails during actual burn operations, causing fee collection failures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidFeeToken()] [Error Message] The error message at line 131 only mentions the symbol - should it also validate that the token has sufficient properties for method fee usage beyond burnability?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Input: MethodFees.MethodName] [Missing Validation] SetMethodFee at line 20 stores input.MethodName without validating it's a real contract method - can an attacker set fees for non-existent methods to waste storage? (Low)",
