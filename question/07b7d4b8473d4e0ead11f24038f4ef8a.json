  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNextTerm()] [BlockchainAge Calculation] Line 247 calls GetBlockchainAge.

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNextTerm()] [ContainsKey Race] Line 249 checks ContainsKey before accessing.

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetBlockchainAge()] [Negative Age] Line 263 subtracts timestamps.

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TryToGetVictories()] [Empty Victories] Line 282 checks if Pubkeys.Any(). If Election returns empty victories, does caller handle false return properly, or does it cause miner list to become empty? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TryToGetVictories()] [Logging Information Leak] Lines 275-277 log first 20 chars of pubkeys. Can this information disclosure help attackers predict or manipulate election results? (Low)",
