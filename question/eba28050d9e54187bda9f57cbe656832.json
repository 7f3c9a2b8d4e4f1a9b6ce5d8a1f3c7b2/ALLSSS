  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Function: GetAbsModulus()] [Negative Modulus Result] long % int can be negative in C# - Math.Abs makes it positive, but is this always desired behavior in modular arithmetic? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: RoundId vs GetHash()] [Consistency] RoundId is computed from ExpectedMiningTime sum, while GetHash() excludes ActualMiningTimes - can rounds with same RoundId have different hashes, or vice versa, breaking uniqueness assumptions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: GetMiningInterval vs CheckRoundTimeSlots] [Validation Gap] GetMiningInterval() uses only first two miners, CheckRoundTimeSlots() validates all pairs - can interval from GetMiningInterval() differ from intervals validated by CheckRoundTimeSlots()? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: FirstMiner vs FirstActualMiner] [Null Handling] FirstMiner() returns empty object, FirstActualMiner() returns null - inconsistent null handling could cause callers to crash depending on which function they use? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: IsTimeSlotPassed vs GetExtraBlockMiningTime] [Time Consistency] IsTimeSlotPassed() adds interval to ExpectedMiningTime, GetExtraBlockMiningTime() adds to last miner's time - can these create overlapping or contradictory time windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: GetExpectedMiningTime vs GetMiningOrder] [Sentinel Values] Both return sentinel values (long.MaxValue, int.MaxValue) for not-found - do callers handle both consistently, or can mixing calls cause bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: TryToDetectEvilMiners vs IsTimeSlotPassed] [Missed Slots Increment] TryToDetectEvilMiners checks MissedTimeSlots count, but this file doesn't show where MissedTimeSlots is incremented - is there race between increment and detection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: NeedToChangeTerm vs IsTimeToChangeTerm] [Consensus Threshold] NeedToChangeTerm() requires MinersCountOfConsent agree - can attacker submit conflicting ActualMiningTimes to different miners to prevent reaching consensus threshold? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round.cs] [Cross-Function: GetCheckableRound vs CalculateSignature] [State Integrity] GetCheckableRound() clears pieces/times for hashing, CalculateSignature() uses Signature field - can attacker modify Round state between hash and signature operations? (High)"
