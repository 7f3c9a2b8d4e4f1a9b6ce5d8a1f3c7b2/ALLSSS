  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Integer Overflow] Can the negative Seconds value (-62135596800L) cause integer overflow when added to positive timestamps in voting period calculations, allowing attackers to create invalid time ranges? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Boundary Validation] Does the MinValue (0001-01-01T00:00:00Z) with Seconds=-62135596800L correctly represent the minimum Timestamp, or can serialization/deserialization alter this value allowing time-based bypass?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Timezone Edge Case] Is the MinValue timestamp (0001-01-01T00:00:00Z) correctly handled across all timezone conversions, or can local time operations cause it to become invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Comparison Logic] When MinValue is compared with current block timestamps in consensus validation, can the extreme negative value cause comparison operator failures or unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Integer Overflow] Can the MaxValue Seconds (253402300799L) cause overflow when used in addition operations for voting end time calculations, wrapping to negative values? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Nanos Boundary] Is the MaxValue Nanos=999999999 correctly validated as the maximum valid nanoseconds value, or can operations exceed this causing invalid timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Duration Overflow] When MaxValue is used in duration calculations (MaxValue - currentTime), can the resulting duration overflow long.MaxValue causing arithmetic exceptions? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Voting Period DOS] When MaxValue is used as EndTimestamp in voting registration, can this create infinitely-long voting periods that prevent proper vote settlement and reward distribution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Memory Exhaustion] Does the non-singleton pattern of creating new Timestamp instances for each MaxValue access enable memory exhaustion attacks in contracts with frequent timestamp operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Year 9999 Edge Case] Is the MaxValue year 9999 handled correctly in all date arithmetic operations, or can calendar library assumptions about modern dates cause crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Comparison Edge Case] When MaxValue is compared with real timestamps in vote expiration checks, can rounding errors in Nanos (999999999) cause premature or delayed expirations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Range Validation] When MinValue and MaxValue define a voting time window, is there validation preventing their reversal (MinValue > MaxValue) in calling contracts? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Consensus Time Validation] Do consensus contracts properly reject blocks with timestamps outside [MinValue, MaxValue] range, or can extreme timestamps corrupt miner schedules? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Cross-Chain Timestamp Sync] When side chains use these boundary values, can timestamp synchronization failures allow votes on side chains to be accepted outside the parent chain's time range? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Vote Time Window Bypass] Since voting registration uses MinValue/MaxValue for StartTimestamp/EndTimestamp, can attackers exploit the infinite time window to vote multiple times across different rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Protobuf Encoding Consistency] Are MinValue (negative seconds) and MaxValue (large positive seconds) encoded consistently across different Protobuf library versions, preventing deserialization attacks?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Instance Creation Performance] Does the pattern of creating new Timestamp instances (not reusing singletons) for both MinValue and MaxValue enable DOS through excessive GC pressure in voting-heavy scenarios? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [VotingRegisterInput Usage] When used as StartTimestamp=MinValue and EndTimestamp=MaxValue in VotingRegisterInput, does this create a voting item that never expires, preventing proper cleanup and state management?
