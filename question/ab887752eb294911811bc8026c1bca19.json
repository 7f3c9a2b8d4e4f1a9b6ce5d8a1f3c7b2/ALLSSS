  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [External Failure] If Token contract's IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee always reverts or fails, SetMethodFee() becomes permanently unusable blocking all fee management? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Storage Lock] Attacker with controller access can set fees for thousands of method names filling State.TransactionFees mapping, causing future operations to hit storage limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] [Controller Lock] ChangeMethodFeeController() to organization with impossible approval threshold effectively DOS's future fee changes as new controller can never authorize SetMethodFee()? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Empty Fees] What happens if SetMethodFee() is called with input.Fees as empty collection - does foreach loop skip validation allowing zero-fee methods? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Same Address] Can ChangeMethodFeeController() set new controller with OwnerAddress == ContractAddress creating self-referential authority loop? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Null Returns] External calls like GetDefaultOrganizationAddress.Call() - what if they return null/default Address instead of valid address, breaking authorization logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Repeated Changes] Can ChangeMethodFeeController() be called repeatedly in same block, and does each CheckOrganizationExist() external call compound gas costs enabling economic DOS? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Zero Amount] AssertValidToken() allows amount=0 after >= check - are zero-fee methods exploitable for free transactions bypassing economic model? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ACS1 Compliance] [Interface] Does SetMethodFee() properly emit events as required by ACS1 standard, or is silent update to State.TransactionFees non-compliant causing integration issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ACS1 Compliance] [Fee Structure] MethodFees input with multiple symbol/amount pairs - is there validation that all amounts are positive or can negative fees cause refunds to callers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [ACS1 Compliance] [Controller Authority] Does GetMethodFeeController() return format match ACS1 specification, or could malformed AuthorityInfo break integration with fee collection system? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Combined Attack] [Controller Hijack] Attacker compromises current controller, calls ChangeMethodFeeController() to own organization, then SetMethodFee() to disable all fees enabling free exploitation of Association contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Combined Attack] [Token Manipulation] If attacker controls token contract returned by Context.GetContractAddressByName, can they make IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee return true for malicious tokens then exploit fee collection? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Combined Attack] [Timing] Attacker monitors mempool for ChangeMethodFeeController() transaction, frontruns with SetMethodFee() to lock in favorable fees before controller change completes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Combined Attack] [Multi-Call] Can batch transaction calling GetMethodFeeController(), ChangeMethodFeeController(), and SetMethodFee() in sequence bypass authorization checks through state timing inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Contract Interaction] [Cross-Contract State] RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() reads from Parliament contract but doesn't verify that Parliament's default organization hasn't changed since last read - stale data risk? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Contract Interaction] [Callback Vulnerability] External contracts called via Context.Call could implement callbacks that manipulate Association contract state during the call - no reentrancy guards visible? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Contract Interaction] [Untrusted Input] ChangeMethodFeeController() passes user-supplied input.ContractAddress to Context.Call without whitelist validation - any contract can be specified? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Data Type] [Protobuf Handling] All inputs use protobuf types (MethodFees, AuthorityInfo, StringValue, Empty, BoolValue) - are there deserialization vulnerabilities if malformed protobuf is passed? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Data Type] [Address Type] Address type handling in equality checks - does Address.Equals() work correctly or could address encoding differences cause authorization bypass? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Data Type] [Mapping Return] State.TransactionFees[input.Value] returns MethodFees - if method name doesn't exist, is null returned or default MethodFees instance, affecting fee enforcement? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [MEV] [Fee Frontrunning] Attacker observes pending SetMethodFee() transaction increasing fees, frontruns with own transaction at old fee, then backruns arbitraging the fee change? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [MEV] [Controller Sandwich] Attacker sandwiches ChangeMethodFeeController() transaction between SetMethodFee() calls to exploit brief window where new controller lacks full authority? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Transaction Ordering] [Block Boundary] If SetMethodFee() and method call occur in same block, which fee version applies - could race condition allow calling method before fee increase takes effect?
