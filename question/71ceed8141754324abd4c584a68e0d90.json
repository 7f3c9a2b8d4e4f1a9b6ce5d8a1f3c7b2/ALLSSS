  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Methods] [State Corruption] If State.VotingRecords, State.VotingItems, State.VotingResults, or State.VotedItemsMap are corrupted through bugs in Vote(), Withdraw(), or TakeSnapshot() methods, do these view methods expose the corruption or hide it through null checks and assertions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Methods] [Gas Limits] For view methods that don't modify state, are there still gas limits enforced that could prevent legitimate queries with large result sets (e.g., GetVotingRecords with many IDs)? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Methods] [Reentrancy] Although these are view methods marked with 'is_view', can they be called reentrantly during state-modifying operations, potentially causing inconsistent reads or exposing intermediate states? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [State Mapping] The State.VotingRecords mapping (VoteContractState.cs line 19) maps Hash to VotingRecord - if two different Vote() calls somehow generate the same vote ID hash, would GetVotingRecords() return the overwritten record, causing vote loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [State Mapping] The State.VotedItemsMap (VoteContractState.cs line 24) maps Address to VotedItems - if the same address is used across multiple voting items, does the VotedItemVoteIds map properly segregate votes per voting item, or could there be cross-contamination? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [State Mapping] The State.VotingResults mapping (VoteContractState.cs line 14) uses computed hashes - if GetVotingResultHash() has collisions, could different (VotingItemId, SnapshotNumber) pairs overwrite each other's results? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [State Mapping] The State.VotingItems mapping (VoteContractState.cs line 9) maps Hash to VotingItem - if the voting item ID generation (AssertValidNewVotingItem in VoteContract.cs line 351-366) has flaws, could duplicate IDs overwrite existing voting items? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetLatestVotingResult()] [Integration Bug] Does AssertVotingItem() (VoteContract.cs line 341-346) properly validate all VotingItem fields, or could a malformed voting item pass validation but cause GetLatestVotingResult() to return invalid results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingIds()] [Integration Bug] If UpdateVotedItems() (VoteContract.cs line 146-161) incorrectly manages the VotedItemVoteIds map, could GetVotingIds() return stale or incorrect vote IDs, causing confusion about which votes are active? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Integration Bug] If Vote() (VoteContract.cs line 90-144) creates VotingRecords with incorrect data, does GetVotingRecord() expose this bad data without validation, enabling exploitation of voting logic bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Integration Bug] If UpdateVotingResult() (VoteContract.cs line 169-181) has arithmetic bugs (e.g., in Add() operations), does GetVotingResult() return corrupted vote tallies without detecting the corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Quadratic Voting] For voting items with IsQuadratic=true, if the VotingRecord.Amount is computed incorrectly in Vote() (line 100-103 in VoteContract.cs), does GetVotingRecord() expose the wrong amount, enabling detection of quadratic voting calculation bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Quadratic Voting] For quadratic voting items, does the Results map on VotingResult properly distinguish between vote count (always 1 per quadratic vote) versus vote amount, or could GetVotingResult() return confusing data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Quadratic Voting] If a voting item has IsQuadratic=true but TicketCost=0, does GetVotingItem() expose this invalid configuration that would allow free quadratic voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Snapshot Validity] Can attackers query historical snapshot results for snapshots that were never properly finalized by TakeSnapshot(), potentially accessing incomplete or inconsistent voting tallies? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetLatestVotingResult()] [Snapshot Race] If TakeSnapshot() (VoteContract.cs line 241-273) is called between line 46 (AssertVotingItem) and line 50 (accessing CurrentSnapshotNumber), does GetLatestVotingResult() return the old snapshot or the new one, causing temporal inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Snapshot Overflow] If CurrentSnapshotNumber exceeds TotalSnapshotNumber due to bugs in TakeSnapshot(), does GetVotingItem() expose this invalid state that should prevent further voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Withdrawal Status] If Withdraw() (VoteContract.cs line 191-239) incorrectly sets IsWithdrawn=true but fails to unlock tokens, does GetVotingRecord() showing IsWithdrawn=true mislead users into thinking their tokens are unlocked when they're still locked? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Withdrawal Tracking] If the WithdrawnVotes list in VotedIds is not properly maintained by Withdraw(), does GetVotedItems() return incorrect withdrawal history, causing users to lose track of which votes they've withdrawn? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Lock Token] If IsLockToken=false (delegated voting), does GetVotingItem() clearly indicate this, or could users mistake it for a locking voting item and expect token locking that won't happen? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Options Validity] If AddOption/RemoveOption/AddOptions/RemoveOptions methods corrupt the Options list (e.g., duplicates, empty strings), does GetVotingItem() expose this corruption without validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Options Mismatch] If the Results map contains options that are not in the voting item's Options list (due to RemoveOption after votes were cast), does GetVotingResult() return these orphaned results without indicating they're invalid? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Option Validity] If a VotingRecord.Option is no longer in the voting item's Options list, does GetVotingRecord() expose this inconsistency, or should it validate that the option is still valid? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Sponsor Privacy] Does exposing the Sponsor address enable targeting or harassment of voting item creators, especially for controversial votes, violating expected anonymity? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Sponsor Validation] If the Sponsor address in a VotingItem is corrupted or set to an invalid address, does GetVotingItem() expose this without validation, potentially hiding sponsor impersonation attacks? (Low)"
