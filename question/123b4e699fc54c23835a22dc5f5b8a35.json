  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Single Miner Bypass] Does the early return at line 76 when minersCount <= 1 allow a single miner to mine continuously without any break, centralizing consensus completely? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Order Swap Logic] If firstMinerOfNextRound and secondMinerOfNextRound at lines 79-84 are actually the same object reference (e.g., due to corrupted miner list), does swapping Order and ExpectedMiningTime cause self-corruption that breaks time slot integrity? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Null Reference] If Order == 2 miner doesn't exist when First() is called at line 83-84, does this throw an exception that halts round generation permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [GetExtraBlockProducerInformation] If GetExtraBlockProducerInformation at line 80 returns null or invalid data, can the Pubkey comparison at line 81 fail silently, skipping the swap and allowing continuous mining? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Last Miner Null] If lastMinerOfNextRound is null at line 95 early return, but extraBlockProducerOfNextRound at line 97 happens to have Order == minersCount, does this create an inconsistency where the extra block producer's order conflicts with a non-existent last miner? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Order Mutation Side Effects] When Order values are swapped at lines 85-86 and 102-103, are there downstream references to these miners that become stale, causing consensus commands to target wrong miners? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [ExpectedMiningTime Swap] If ExpectedMiningTime swap at lines 87-89 and 104-106 is interrupted or partially applied, can miners end up with wrong timestamps that violate time slot ordering invariants? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Ref Parameter Mutation] Since nextRound is passed by ref at line 73, can external code maintain stale references to the old state, causing split-brain scenarios where different parts of the system see different round states? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Two Miner Edge Case] With exactly 2 miners, if both swaps (lines 81-90 and 98-107) trigger simultaneously, can the miner at order 1 get swapped twice, ending up at an invalid position? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Extra Block Producer Prediction] If an attacker can predict who will be the extra block producer using the logic at line 97, can they strategically position themselves to avoid being swapped, maintaining their preferred mining position? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Order Collision After Swap] After swapping orders at lines 85-86, if the new order 1 miner was originally at a different position, does this create duplicate order values if the original order 1 position isn't cleared? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Last Miner Detection] If FirstOrDefault at line 93-94 returns null but Count > 1, does this indicate corrupted order assignments that should trigger validation failure rather than silent skip? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Timestamp Immutability] Are ExpectedMiningTime values at lines 87-89 and 104-106 validated after swap to ensure they still maintain chronological order, or can swaps create time inversions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [minersCount.Sub(1)] If minersCount is 1 at line 101 and 103, does Sub(1) return 0, causing Order to be set to 0 which violates the [1, minersCount] order range? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: BreakContinuousMining()] [Continuous Mining Window] Does swapping only first/last positions allow a miner to continuously mine at middle positions (e.g., always order minersCount/2) across rounds without detection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: CalculateNextExtraBlockProducerOrder()] [No Signature DOS] If no miners produce blocks (firstPlaceInfo == null at line 114), does defaulting to order 1 at line 116 make the extra block producer fully predictable, allowing targeted attacks against that miner? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: CalculateNextExtraBlockProducerOrder()] [Signature Manipulation] Can the first miner who produces a block at line 112-113 manipulate their Signature value to influence the modulo result at line 121, ensuring they or an ally becomes the extra block producer?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: CalculateNextExtraBlockProducerOrder()] [Negative sigNum] If sigNum at line 119 is negative (e.g., due to signature encoding), does GetAbsModulus handle this correctly, or can negative values produce out-of-range order values?
