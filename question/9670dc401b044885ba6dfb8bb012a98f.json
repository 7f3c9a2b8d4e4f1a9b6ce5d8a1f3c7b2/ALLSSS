  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime] [DoS/Resource Exhaustion] If ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime=10 is too low, could beneficiaries with >10 profit details be forced into excessive transaction costs to claim all profits, effectively creating a griefing vector where attackers add many small-share beneficiary entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime] [Economic Efficiency] Could the hardcoded limit of 10 profit details per claim cause legitimate users with many profit streams to experience significantly higher gas costs compared to users with fewer streams, creating an unfair economic burden? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime] [Profit Loss] If a scheme manager maliciously adds 100+ beneficiary entries for a single address before that address can claim, does the 10-detail limit force unclaimed profits to expire beyond ProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount, causing permanent loss? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime] [Immutability Risk] Since ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime=10 is a compile-time constant with no governance mechanism to adjust it, could future network growth or changed usage patterns make this limit obsolete, requiring contract redeployment? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime] [Front-Running] Could an attacker monitor pending ClaimProfits transactions and front-run by adding new profit details to the same beneficiary, forcing the original transaction to process only 10 of (10+N) details and potentially changing the order of profit claiming? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Profit Expiration] If DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount=10 is used when creating schemes without explicit period specification, could short-lived schemes cause beneficiaries to lose unclaimed profits after only 10 periods due to automatic cleanup? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Default Value Risk] Does the default value of 10 periods provide insufficient time for beneficiaries to claim in scenarios with long period durations (e.g., monthly/yearly), potentially causing unintended profit loss? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Storage Bloat] If DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount=10 is too high for frequently-rotating profit schemes, could it lead to excessive storage accumulation of old profit details that are never claimed? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Configuration Mismatch] Could schemes created with the default value of 10 periods have incompatible due period counts compared to schemes that explicitly set MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount=1024, causing cross-scheme profit distribution inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Storage DoS] Could an attacker create schemes with ProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount=1024 (maximum) and distribute profits across all 1024 periods, causing unbounded state growth that exhausts storage capacity or makes cleanup operations prohibitively expensive? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Computation DoS] If MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount=1024 periods are accumulated without claims, could the iteration through all periods in profit calculation functions cause out-of-gas errors, effectively locking funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Cleanup Cost] Does the maximum value of 1024 periods create scenarios where cleanup of expired profit details becomes computationally expensive enough to prevent normal scheme operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Validation Gap] Is the assertion that checks ProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount <= 1024 sufficient, or could overflow/underflow in period arithmetic with such large values cause unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Economic Attack] Could malicious scheme creators set ProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount to 1024 and distribute minimal profits across all periods to artificially inflate beneficiary claim costs, making profit claiming economically unviable? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenAmountLimit] [Method Fee Limitation] If TokenAmountLimit=5 restricts method fees to only 5 different token symbols, could this prevent proper fee diversification in multi-token ecosystems or force unnecessary fee structure centralization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenAmountLimit] [Extensibility Barrier] Does the hardcoded limit of 5 tokens in SetMethodFee create a permanent constraint that cannot adapt to growing token ecosystems without contract redeployment? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenAmountLimit] [Priority Manipulation] If only 5 tokens are allowed for method fees, could the fee controller selectively choose tokens to disadvantage certain users or create unfair transaction cost structures? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenAmountLimit] [DoS via Token Saturation] Could an attacker or compromised fee controller set 5 obscure/illiquid tokens as method fees, effectively pricing out legitimate users who don't hold those specific tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime] [Computational Limit] If DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime=100 is used and a beneficiary has 10 profit details, could claiming 10*100=1000 period-profit combinations in one transaction exceed block gas limits and cause DoS? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime] [Forced Fragmentation] Does the limit of 100 periods per claim force users with long-term profit streams (e.g., 500 unclaimed periods) to make 5+ separate transactions, significantly increasing their total gas costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime] [Race Condition] Could the 100-period claiming limit create race conditions where multiple beneficiaries compete to claim from the same scheme periods, with earlier claimants reducing available profits for later ones within the same period batch? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime] [Governance Bypass Risk] Since this default can be overridden by governance through SetMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCount, could a malicious governance action set an extremely high value that causes guaranteed out-of-gas failures on all claim attempts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constant: DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime] [Default vs Override Confusion] If different schemes operate with different MaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCount values (default 100 vs governance-set values), could this create user confusion about claim limits and lead to failed transactions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constants: ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime + DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime] [Combined DoS] With ProfitReceivingLimitForEachTime=10 and DefaultMaximumProfitReceivingPeriodCountOfOneTime=100, could claiming 10 details * 100 periods = 1000 operations exceed transaction limits and lock funds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ProfitContractConstants.cs] [Constants: DefaultProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount + MaximumProfitReceivingDuePeriodCount] [Value Range Risk] The 102x difference between default (10) and maximum (1024) due period counts could lead to vastly different behavior for schemes, potentially causing integration issues or unexpected profit loss scenarios. Are there adequate warnings? (Low)"
