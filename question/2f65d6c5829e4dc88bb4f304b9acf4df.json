  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/IHeaderInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Interface Design] Does the IHeaderInformationValidationProvider interface lack version control or capability negotiation, potentially causing issues when validation requirements change across protocol upgrades? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/IHeaderInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Interface Design] Does ValidateHeaderInformation() lack a mechanism to distinguish between different failure types (authentication vs validation vs data integrity), potentially masking the root cause of validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/IHeaderInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Interface Design] Can the ConsensusValidationContext parameter be mutated by implementations, potentially causing side effects or inconsistent validation behavior across multiple providers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/IHeaderInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Interface Design] Does the interface lack ordering guarantees for when multiple providers are used, potentially allowing bypass if a critical validation runs after a less strict one has already passed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/IHeaderInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Interface Design] Is there a missing interface method for pre-validation initialization or provider registration, potentially allowing malicious implementations to be injected? (High)"
