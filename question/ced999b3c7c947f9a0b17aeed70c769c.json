  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Assignment Order] Lines 42 and 44 set SupposedOrderOfNextRound and FinalOrderOfNextRound to the same value initially. If conflict resolution at lines 28-40 runs before these assignments, the values would differ. Does the order of operations matter for correctness? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Update Sequence] OutValue and Signature are updated at lines 12-13 before conflict resolution runs at lines 25-40. If conflict resolution depends on these values being set, is there a dependency issue? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Missing Error Handling] The function lacks try-catch blocks for potential exceptions in dictionary access, LINQ operations, or GetAbsModulus(). Can unhandled exceptions cause consensus halts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Silent Errors] If the conflict resolution at lines 28-40 fails to find a valid maybeNewOrder for a conflicted miner, the break at line 38 is never reached, and the miner's FinalOrderOfNextRound remains unchanged. Is this silent failure acceptable? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Consensus Safety] Can a Byzantine miner who controls timing of ApplyNormalConsensusData() calls manipulate the sequence of conflict resolutions to ensure they always get the first mining slot in the next round? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Fairness] If miners can see the signature values and resulting supposedOrderOfNextRound of earlier callers before submitting their own, can they game the system to always avoid conflicts and maintain favorable positions? (Medium)"
