  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Proposer Validation] No validation of proposal.Proposer field - can this be null or manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Multiple Validation Calls] This function is called in multiple places - can inconsistent validation timing create security gaps? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [Empty String Bypass] Line 117-118 returns true for empty strings, allowing proposals without description URLs - is this intended behavior? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [URI Parsing Exploit] Can an attacker craft malicious URIs that pass TryCreate but contain exploitable content (XSS, SSRF, etc.)? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [Scheme Restriction] Only HTTP and HTTPS schemes are allowed - can this be bypassed with case variations or encoded characters? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [Absolute URI Only] Only absolute URIs are accepted (UriKind.Absolute) - can relative URIs cause unexpected behavior if validation changes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme()] [URL Length] No length validation - can extremely long URLs cause DOS or storage issues? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: GetValidProposal()] [Double Validation] This function calls Validate() which is also called elsewhere - can proposals become invalid between multiple validations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: GetValidProposal()] [Null Proposal Exploit] Line 127 asserts proposal is not null but line 128 validates it - can a race condition between these lines be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: GetValidProposal()] [Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use] Proposal validation happens at retrieval time, not execution time - can proposals expire or become invalid after retrieval? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: GetTokenInfo()] [Return Value Validation] No validation that returned TokenInfo is complete or valid - can null/invalid token info cause downstream issues? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: GenerateProposalId()] [Hash Collision] Line 156 uses either input.Token or ComputeFrom(input) - can an attacker craft inputs to create proposal ID collisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: GenerateProposalId()] [Token Nullability] If input.Token is null, falls back to HashHelper.ComputeFrom - can an attacker control which path is taken to manipulate proposal IDs? (High)",
