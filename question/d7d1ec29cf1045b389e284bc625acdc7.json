  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Computation Attack] ValidateHeaderInformation has simple O(1) logic - but if called for every block proposal, can an attacker flood the network with proposals to exhaust validator CPU? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Side Chain Exploitation] Does ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider apply identically to main chain and side chains, and can side chain miners exploit different initialization or round counting to bypass limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Cross-Chain State] If LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount is synchronized across chains, can an attacker exploit inconsistent cross-chain state to produce blocks on one chain while their counter is decremented on another? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Round Number Edge] At exactly RoundNumber==3, does the first validation occur correctly, or is there a boundary condition where rounds 2->3 transition allows extra blocks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Miner Count Edge] At exactly RealTimeMinersInformation.Count==2, validation applies - can a miner exploit the 2->1 transition to produce multiple blocks as the last miner drops out? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [BlocksCount Boundary] At BlocksCount==-1, validation correctly rejects - but can ResetLatestProviderToTinyBlocksCount have integer underflow that skips -1 and goes to a large negative number, bypassing the check? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Empty Pubkey] If Pubkey is empty string or null, does string comparison on line 18 behave correctly, or can an attacker use empty pubkey to always mismatch and bypass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Network Split] During network partition, if different partitions have different LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount values, can a miner produce blocks on both sides exceeding limits when partitions merge? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Chain Reorganization] If a chain reorg occurs, does LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount roll back correctly, or can a miner exploit stale counter values to produce blocks that were valid pre-reorg but invalid post-reorg? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Time Manipulation] If miners can manipulate block timestamps, can they cause round transitions that reset continuous block counters more frequently than intended, bypassing limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Consensus Stall] If all miners except one are offline and Count==1 bypass activates, can the remaining miner produce blocks indefinitely without continuous block limits, enabling censorship or double-spend attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Negative Round] Can ProvidedRound.RoundNumber be negative, and if so, does the >2 check on line 13 incorrectly pass negative values that should be rejected? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Zero Miners] If RealTimeMinersInformation is empty (Count==0), does Count!=1 pass on line 14, and is this correct behavior or should zero miners be rejected? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Duplicate Miners] If RealTimeMinersInformation contains duplicate entries inflating Count, can a single miner appear as multiple miners to bypass the single miner exception? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [BlocksCount Overflow] Can BlocksCount be set to Int64.MaxValue, and when ResetLatestProviderToTinyBlocksCount decrements, does it overflow to negative without triggering the <0 check? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Validation Order] ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider runs after MiningPermissionValidationProvider and TimeSlotValidationProvider - can a block fail other validators but still update LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount, causing state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Multi-Validator Bypass] If MiningPermissionValidationProvider has bugs allowing unauthorized miners, can those miners also bypass ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider by not being in LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount tracking? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Validator Independence] Does ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider depend on UpdateValueValidationProvider or other validators running first, and can skipping those validators cause this one to misbehave? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [State Race] If multiple blocks are validated concurrently, can they all read the same LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount value before any decrements are written, allowing all to pass when some should fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Atomic Update] Is the read on line 16 and the update in ResetLatestProviderToTinyBlocksCount atomic, or can interleaving cause lost updates where a decrement is overwritten? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Transaction Rollback] If ValidateHeaderInformation passes but the block is later rejected and transaction rolled back, does LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount decrement get rolled back or persist incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Collusion Attack] Can miners collude to time their blocks such that each produces maximum continuous blocks in sequence without triggering validation, effectively controlling block production? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/ContinuousBlocksValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Grief Attack] Can a miner deliberately exhaust their BlocksCount to negative to force validation failures, then switch identity, repeatedly griefing the network with rejected blocks?
