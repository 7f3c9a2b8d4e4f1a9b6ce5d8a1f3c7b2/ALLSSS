  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet()] [Initialization Race] If two transactions simultaneously call methods that invoke RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet at line 31-43 when State.MaximumMinersCountController.Value is null, can both bypass the return at line 33 and both call State.ParliamentContract.GetDefaultOrganizationAddress, causing double-initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet()] [Parliament Dependency] If EnsureParliamentContractAddressSet at line 34 fails or State.ParliamentContract.Value is null/invalid, does the GetDefaultOrganizationAddress.Call at line 38 fail ungracefully, causing all functions that call RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet to become unusable? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet()] [Malicious Default Org] If State.ParliamentContract.GetDefaultOrganizationAddress.Call returns an address controlled by an attacker (e.g., Parliament contract bug), does State.MaximumMinersCountController.Value get initialized with attacker-controlled OwnerAddress, allowing immediate takeover of SetMaximumMinersCount? (Critical)",

(Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet()] [Authority Validation] The function doesn't validate that the returned organization address from GetDefaultOrganizationAddress is non-zero or valid.

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet()] [State Check Bypass] The check at line 33 uses != null which could pass if State.MaximumMinersCountController.Value is an empty AuthorityInfo object (not null but with empty fields).
