  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Null Reference] If proposerWhiteList parameter is null, does the method throw NullReferenceException when accessing proposerWhiteList.Proposers.Count, allowing DoS of organization validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Null Reference] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers collection itself is null (not just empty), does accessing .Count throw unhandled exception during organization creation validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Null Reference] If proposerWhiteList is null when Empty() is called during Validate(organization), does it cause contract execution failure that prevents legitimate organization creation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Null Reference] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers is null, does Empty() throw exception through Count() call, bypassing the organization validation that should reject empty whitelists? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Null Reference] If proposerWhiteList is null when Contains() is called in AssertIsAuthorizedProposer, can this cause proposal creation to fail with unhandled exception instead of proper authorization denial? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Null Reference] If address parameter is null, does Contains() fail to properly return false, potentially allowing null address to be treated as authorized proposer? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Null Reference] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers collection is null, does Contains() throw NullReferenceException during authorization check, causing DoS for all proposal creation attempts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Authorization Bypass] Does the Contains() method use reference equality or value equality for Address comparison, and could attackers create equivalent addresses that bypass whitelist checks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Authorization Bypass] If ProposerWhiteList.Proposers contains duplicate addresses, does Contains() return different results based on position, creating inconsistent authorization states? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Authorization Bypass] If Empty() returns false due to whitelist containing only null/invalid addresses, does this bypass the validation requirement that organizations must have valid proposers? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [DoS] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers contains millions of addresses, does Count() operation consume excessive gas during organization validation, creating DoS vector? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [DoS] Does Contains() perform O(n) linear search through proposerWhiteList.Proposers, allowing attackers to create organizations with huge whitelists that make proposal authorization checks prohibitively expensive? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [DoS] If whitelist contains duplicate addresses, does each Contains() check iterate through all duplicates, multiplying gas costs and enabling griefing attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [DoS] Does Empty() unnecessarily call Count() which iterates the entire collection, when checking Proposers.Count == 0 directly would be more gas efficient? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Edge Case] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers.Count exceeds int.MaxValue, does Count() overflow or throw exception during organization validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Edge Case] If Count() returns negative value due to corrupted state, does Empty() incorrectly return false, allowing invalid organizations to pass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Edge Case] If proposerWhiteList.Proposers contains the zero address (Address.Zero), does Contains() properly identify it, or could zero address bypass authorization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Edge Case] If the same address appears multiple times in proposerWhiteList.Proposers, does Contains() behave consistently, or could removal of one duplicate affect authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Integration] When Empty() is called in Validate() at organization creation, if it returns false but all addresses are invalid/zero addresses, does this create unusable organizations that pass validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Integration] When Contains() is used in AssertIsAuthorizedProposer, if the organization's whitelist was modified after proposal creation started, could race condition allow unauthorized proposal? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Integration] When Contains() checks proposer authorization, if address parameter comes from Context.Sender in CreateProposal but OriginProposer in CreateProposalBySystemContract, could this create authorization inconsistency? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Count()] [Integration] When Count() is used in Empty() check during organization validation, if count is exactly zero, does this properly prevent organization creation or could subsequent checks bypass this?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ProposerWhiteListExtensions.cs] [Function: Contains()] [Race Condition] If ProposerWhiteList is modified via ChangeOrganizationProposerWhiteList between proposal creation authorization check and actual proposal storage, could unauthorized proposals be created?
