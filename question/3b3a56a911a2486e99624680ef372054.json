  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [EndTimestamp Expiration] When EndTimestamp=MaxValue is used in voting, do reward settlement and vote counting functions correctly handle a timestamp 8000 years in the future, or do they assume nearer expiration dates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Hash Computation Impact] When MinValue/MaxValue are included in VotingRegisterInput that gets hashed for MinerElectionVotingItemId, can the extreme values cause hash collision vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [TotalSnapshotNumber Interaction] Does using MinValue/MaxValue timestamps with TotalSnapshotNumber=long.MaxValue create an unbounded voting system that can be exploited for infinite vote accumulation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [IsLockToken Bypass] When IsLockToken=false and time range is [MinValue, MaxValue], can attackers vote without locking tokens since the infinite time window never triggers lock expiration checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Type Casting] Can the -62135596800L seconds value cause issues when cast to int32 or other smaller types in contract logic expecting positive timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Type Conversion] When MaxValue.Seconds (253402300799L) is converted to milliseconds or nanoseconds, does multiplication overflow occur causing incorrect time comparisons? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Implicit Conversion] Are there implicit conversions between Timestamp and DateTime that fail for MinValue/MaxValue's extreme ranges, causing runtime exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Class: TimestampHelper] [Public Static Access] Does the public static nature of TimestampHelper allow any contract to create unbounded voting time ranges, bypassing intended time-based governance restrictions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Class: TimestampHelper] [Namespace Collision] Can the AElf.Contracts.Election.TimestampHelper conflict with AElf.Kernel.Types.TimestampHelper causing incorrect import and wrong boundary values being used? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Hardcoded Value Correctness] Is the hardcoded Seconds=-62135596800L mathematically correct for 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z, or is there an off-by-one error allowing dates before year 1? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Nanos Precision] Is Nanos=999999999 exactly the maximum nanosecond value, or should it be 999999990 or another value to prevent sub-nanosecond precision errors? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Property Immutability] Since MinValue and MaxValue are properties (not readonly fields), can reflection or unsafe code modify these values at runtime to corrupt all timestamp validations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Properties: MinValue + MaxValue] [Instance Mutability] Do the returned Timestamp instances from MinValue/MaxValue allow mutation of Seconds/Nanos fields after retrieval, enabling localized timestamp boundary corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Cross-Contract Consistency] Do all AElf contracts (Consensus, Treasury, Profit, etc.) use the same timestamp boundary definitions, or can inconsistencies allow time-based arbitrage? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Protocol Upgrade Impact] If future protocol upgrades change Timestamp representation or range, will hardcoded MinValue/MaxValue become invalid breaking all historical voting records? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Merkle Proof Timestamps] When MinValue/MaxValue are used in cross-chain merkle proofs, can extreme timestamp values cause proof verification failures on chains with different time representations?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Voting Period Manipulation] Can miners exploit the infinite voting period [MinValue, MaxValue] to delay vote counting indefinitely, preventing candidate election updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Reward Distribution Timing] With no expiration time (MaxValue), can reward distribution be indefinitely postponed allowing funds to accumulate and causing accounting imbalances? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Negative Timestamp Support] Does the underlying Protobuf Timestamp implementation fully support negative Seconds values, or is MinValue an unsupported edge case? (High)",
