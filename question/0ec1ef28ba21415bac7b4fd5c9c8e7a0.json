  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextRound()] [Order Field] Does the validation verify the Order field in RealTimeMinersInformation maintains correct miner ordering for next round, preventing attackers from changing block production sequence? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextRound()] [BlockchainAge Missing] Does the validation check that extraData.Round.BlockchainAge increments correctly from BaseRound.BlockchainAge, or could attackers set arbitrary blockchain age values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextRound()] [ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound] Does the validation verify ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound field is correctly set in next round, or could this be manipulated to affect block producer selection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextRound()] [RealTimeMinersInformation Size] Does the validation check that the number of miners in next round matches expected consensus parameters (max miners, minimum miners), or can attacker add/remove miners freely? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextRound()] [MainChainMiningInterval] Does the validation ensure MainChainMiningInterval or MiningInterval fields in next round are valid and consistent with consensus parameters? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextTerm()] [RoundNumber Reset] Does ValidationForNextTerm check if RoundNumber resets to 1 for new term (as some consensus implementations do), or does it only verify sequential increment, allowing incorrect round-term coupling? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextTerm()] [IsMinerListJustChanged Flag] Does the validation verify that IsMinerListJustChanged or similar flags are set during term transition to indicate new miner list from elections? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/RoundTerminateValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidationForNextTerm()] [Confirmed Irreversible Height] Does ValidationForNextTerm check that term transitions only occur after sufficient block confirmations (irreversible blocks), preventing premature or reversible term changes? (High)"
