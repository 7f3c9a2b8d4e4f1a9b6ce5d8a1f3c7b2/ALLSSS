  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee with input.Fees containing hundreds of entries, each requiring external validation via AssertValidToken at line 13, causing gas exhaustion and preventing legitimate fee updates? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] If Parliament organization used as default controller at line 55 requires many signatures, could the approval process for SetMethodFee become so slow that fee updates lag market conditions, enabling exploitation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [DOS] Can an attacker set fees for critical Election contract methods so high that no one can afford to call them, effectively freezing candidate registration, voting, or election term transitions?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Upgrade Safety] If TokenContract is upgraded at line 78-79 during a contract migration, will existing fee configurations remain valid or could token symbol compatibility break, making all SetMethodFee calls fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Migration] If State.TransactionFees mapping is migrated to a new format, could existing entries at line 17 become inaccessible, causing GetMethodFee at line 36 to return null for previously configured methods?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Protocol Attack] If the TokenContract referenced at lines 78-79 is compromised to always return false for IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee, can this permanently prevent all SetMethodFee calls, freezing fee governance? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Protocol Attack] Can an attacker exploit cross-contract reentrancy by having a malicious organization contract called at line 69 invoke ElectionContract methods, bypassing the authorization check at line 24? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Economic Attack] Can a malicious controller set asymmetric fees via SetMethodFee where some methods are expensive and others are free, creating economic imbalances that favor certain users or attack vectors?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Economic Attack] If SetMethodFee allows fees to be set in tokens with volatile prices, could an attacker time their fee updates to exploit price changes, making methods temporarily unaffordable? (Medium)",
