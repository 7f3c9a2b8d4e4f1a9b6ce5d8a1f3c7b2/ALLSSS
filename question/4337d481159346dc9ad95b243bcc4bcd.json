  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIdsToElectionContract()] [Authorization Bypass] If ElectionContract.SetTreasurySchemeIds at line 201 doesn't validate sender, could scheme IDs be overwritten post-initialization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIdsToElectionContract()] [Scheme Duplication] Are there checks that the five scheme IDs (Treasury, Welcome, Flexible, Subsidy, Welfare) are all unique? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: InitializeTokenConverterContract()] [Connector Weight Manipulation] Native token connector weight is hardcoded as '0.5' at line 222 - could this be manipulated through string injection or precision errors? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: InitializeTokenConverterContract()] [Connector Weight Imbalance] Resource token connectors have weight '0.005' at line 235 - is this 100x difference from native token weight (0.5) intentional, and could it create arbitrage opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: InitializeTokenConverterContract()] [Virtual Balance Manipulation] NativeTokenConnectorInitialVirtualBalance (100K tokens) at line 223 - is this value validated to be consistent with actual token supply? (Medium)",

(High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: InitializeTokenConverterContract()] [Connector Configuration] IsDepositAccount = false for resource tokens (line 238) but true for native token connectors (line 248) - could this asymmetry be exploited? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: InitializeTokenConverterContract()] [State Race Condition] TokenConverterContract.Value is set at line 213 then used at line 254 - could concurrent transactions corrupt state? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: AssertValidMemo()] [UTF-8 Encoding Bypass] The function checks UTF-8 byte count at line 264 - could multi-byte Unicode characters bypass the MemoMaxLength check while displaying much shorter strings? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: AssertValidMemo()] [Memo Content Injection] Only size is validated, not content - could memos contain malicious scripts, SQL injection, or control characters that break downstream processing? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract.cs] [Function: AssertValidMemo()] [MemoMaxLength Constant] MemoMaxLength is set to 64 bytes in constants - could this limit be insufficient for legitimate use cases or too large for gas efficiency? (Low)",
