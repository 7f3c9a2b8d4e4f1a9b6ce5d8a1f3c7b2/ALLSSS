  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Error Handling] [External Call Failure] No try-catch around Context.Call and external contract calls - does transaction always revert on external failure or can attacker force specific revert behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Recovery] [Emergency] No emergency pause or recovery mechanism visible - if bug is found in fee logic, how can it be disabled without controller cooperation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Permission Escalation] [Initialization] If attacker calls GetMethodFeeController() before legitimate initialization, can they influence RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() execution and default controller setup? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Permission Escalation] [Organization Takeover] If attacker gains control of organization set as MethodFeeController, they inherit full fee management powers - is organization change monitored? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Permission Escalation] [Contract Upgrade] If Association contract is upgraded, does new version preserve State.MethodFeeController.Value or can attacker reset during upgrade? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [State Transition] [Atomicity] SetMethodFee() performs validation loop then state update - non-atomic operation means partial validation could complete before revert, wasting gas? (Low)",
