  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForTitle] [Input Validation] If the consuming code doesn't properly enforce the MaxLengthForTitle=255 limit, could an attacker submit proposal titles exceeding this length to cause string truncation, storage bloat, or UI rendering issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Input Validation] If the MaxLengthForDescription=10200 limit is not enforced in proposal creation logic, could attackers submit extremely large descriptions to cause storage DOS or excessive gas consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForProposalDescriptionUrl] [Input Validation] If the MaxLengthForProposalDescriptionUrl=255 limit is bypassed in consuming contracts, could malicious actors inject oversized URLs to exploit downstream URL parsers or storage mechanisms? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForTitle] [Business Logic] Is 255 characters sufficient for international/multi-language proposal titles, or could legitimate governance proposals be rejected due to UTF-8 encoding length vs character count mismatches? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Resource Exhaustion] Does the 10200-byte description limit adequately prevent storage-based DOS attacks while allowing sufficient proposal detail for legitimate governance decisions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForProposalDescriptionUrl] [Configuration] If these constants are referenced by multiple contracts but validation is inconsistent, could discrepancies between Association, Parliament, and Referendum contracts create validation bypass opportunities? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constants: All] [Immutability] Since these are compile-time constants, is there a governance mechanism to update these limits if they prove inadequate, or would it require contract redeployment creating upgrade risks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Data Integrity] Could the 10200-byte limit be exploited by encoding malicious scripts or injection payloads within proposal descriptions if consuming systems don't sanitize the content?
