  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand] [Edge Case] Can the strategy be used when CurrentRound has expired multiple rounds ago, and if so, does ArrangeExtraBlockMiningTime handle the gap correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand] [Edge Case] If all miners in CurrentRound have missed their slots, can ArrangeExtraBlockMiningTime still produce valid arrangedMiningTime? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand] [Edge Case] When multiple miners request consensus commands simultaneously for the same round, can race conditions cause multiple conflicting NextRound/NextTerm commands? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand] [Missing Validation] Does the method validate that Pubkey corresponds to a valid miner in CurrentRound.RealTimeMinersInformation before generating commands? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand] [Missing Validation] Can the method be called when the blockchain is in maintenance mode or emergency state, potentially causing invalid consensus transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand] [Missing Validation] Does the method check that CurrentRound has reached the minimum participation threshold before allowing round termination?
