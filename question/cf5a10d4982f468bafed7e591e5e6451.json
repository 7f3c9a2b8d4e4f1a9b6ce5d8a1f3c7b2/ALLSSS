  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Logic Error] If all candidates in latestSnapshot.ElectionResult are also in input.CurrentMinerList, can alternativeCandidates remain empty even when valid alternatives exist? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetValidCandidates()] [Performance Issue] Linear scan through all candidates - if candidates list grows to thousands, can this make GetVictories calls prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectionResult()] [Trust Boundary] Relies on State.VoteContract.GetVotingResult which is an external contract call - if VoteContract is upgraded maliciously, can it return false election results? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPageableCandidateInformation()] [Logic Error] Math.Min chain: Math.Min(Math.Min(input.Length, 20), candidates.Value.Count.Sub(input.Start)) - if Count < Start, Sub() returns negative, does Math.Min handle this? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVote(string)] [Input Validation Bypass] The Assert checks value.Length > 1, but allows value.Length == 2 which might be too short for valid address/pubkey - can this cause conversion errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [Infinite Loop] If GetNewestPubkey creates circular replacements (A->B, B->A), can this cause infinite loops when resolving banned candidates? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVictories()] [Logic Error] When diff > 0, backups.AddRange adds initial miners, but these might overlap with currentMiners - can this create duplicate entries in victories? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateAdmin()] [Map Poisoning] If State.InitialPubkeyMap contains malicious mappings injected during initialization, can this permanently redirect admin lookups to attacker addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetSponsor()] [Default Address Risk] Fallback to Address.FromPublicKey means sponsor defaults to candidate's own address - can this allow self-sponsorship to bypass sponsor requirements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: TransferVotingRecordToElectionVotingRecord()] [Time Manipulation] UnlockTimestamp calculated as VoteTimestamp.AddSeconds(lockSeconds) - if VoteTimestamp or lockSeconds are manipulated, can votes unlock prematurely? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotersCount() + GetVotesAmount()] [Data Consistency] Both read from State.VoteContract.GetLatestVotingResult separately - can they return values from different voting rounds if called at boundary? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetMinerReplacementInformation()] [Logic Error] alternativeCandidates selection excludes current miners and initial miners, but if replacement candidates are also in these lists, can this fail to find enough alternatives? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetPreviousTermSnapshotWithNewestPubkey()] [State Inconsistency] Removes invalidCandidates where r.Value <= 0, but what if valid candidates later have their votes reduced to <= 0 - can they remain in snapshot? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetElectorVoteWithAllRecords()] [Resource Exhaustion] Loads both active and withdrawn records - if an elector has thousands of historical records, can this cause out-of-memory or timeout? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetCandidateVoteWithAllRecords()] [Resource Exhaustion] Similar to elector records, if a popular candidate has thousands of vote records, can retrieving all crash the query? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVictories()] [Consensus Risk] If validCandidates and backups together are less than MinersCount, can the network operate with insufficient miner count affecting consensus security? (Critical)"
