  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ProcessConsensusInformation.cs] [Function: ProcessUpdateValue()] [InValue Replay] Can a miner reuse a previous InValue/OutValue pair by replaying updateValueInput.PreviousInValue to generate predictable consensus data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_ProcessConsensusInformation.cs] [Function: ProcessUpdateValue()] [ProducedBlocks Counter Overflow] Since minerInRound.ProducedBlocks is incremented without bounds checking, can an attacker cause integer overflow by producing excessive blocks?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract.cs] [Function: SupplyCurrentRoundInformation()] [InValue Forgery] When filling missing miners' InValue with HashHelper.ComputeFrom(miner), can this predictable value be exploited to bias random number generation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract.cs] [Function: SupplyCurrentRoundInformation()] [Signature Reuse] Can the fake signature (signature = previousInValue) in abnormal situations be reused across multiple rounds to break consensus randomness? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract.cs] [Function: RecordCandidateReplacement()] [Round Inconsistency] If ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound is updated but State.Rounds fails to save, can this cause mismatch between Treasury and consensus state? (High)",
