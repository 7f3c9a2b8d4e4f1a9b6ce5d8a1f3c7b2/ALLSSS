  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Access Control] Should only the voter or voting item sponsor be able to query specific voting records, rather than allowing public access? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [State Timing] Can an attacker query a voting record immediately after it's created but before related state updates complete, getting inconsistent snapshot data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [DoS] Can an attacker flood the contract with queries for non-existent records to consume gas and resources while generating assertion failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Data Exposure] Does returning the complete VotingRecord expose sensitive fields like voter address that could compromise anonymity? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Withdrawn Records] Does this method allow querying of withdrawn voting records, potentially exposing historical voting data that should be purged? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Assertion DoS] Can the Assert on line 30 be exploited to cause repeated exceptions by querying non-existent voting item IDs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker enumerate all voting item IDs by observing assertion successes/failures, building a map of all voting activities? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Input Validation] Does the method validate input or input.VotingItemId before accessing state, potentially causing null reference issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Data Exposure] Does returning the complete VotingItem expose sensitive configuration like sponsor address, accepted currency, and voting options to unauthorized parties? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [State Consistency] If the VotingItem is being modified by TakeSnapshot() or option updates during this read, can inconsistent data be returned? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Access Control] Should certain VotingItem fields like sponsor address be restricted to authorized viewers only? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Data Integrity] Is there validation that the returned VotingItem has valid snapshot numbers, timestamps, and option counts? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Timing Attack] Can querying VotingItems at specific times reveal information about when voting activities were created or modified? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [DoS] Can an attacker flood queries for non-existent voting items to generate excessive assertion failures and resource consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Data Leakage] Does exposing the complete VotingItem including options list enable manipulation strategies for future votes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Null Return] If State.VotingResults[votingResultHash] returns null for a valid but not-yet-created snapshot, does the method return null without assertion, masking potential errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker craft input with specific VotingItemId and SnapshotNumber that produces a hash collision with another voting result, retrieving incorrect data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Input Validation] Does the method validate that input, input.VotingItemId, or input.SnapshotNumber are valid before computing the hash? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker query all historical snapshots of a voting item to reconstruct complete voting patterns over time? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Data Integrity] If the VotingResult is being updated concurrently by Vote() or Withdraw(), can this method return partially-updated inconsistent data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Snapshot Manipulation] Can an attacker query future snapshot numbers (not yet taken) to predict voting result structure or test for data leaks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [DoS] Can querying historical snapshots for multiple voting items cause excessive state reads and performance degradation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Privacy] Does exposing detailed voting results including per-option vote counts compromise voter anonymity in small voting groups? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [State Timing] Can an attacker time queries to occur mid-snapshot to gather partial results before voting completes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Negative Snapshot] Does the method validate that SnapshotNumber is positive and within valid range for the voting item? (Low)"
