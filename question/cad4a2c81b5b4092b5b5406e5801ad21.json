  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker exploit missing access control checks when Organizations[address] is directly modified to overwrite organization thresholds, bypass ProposerWhiteList validation, or inject malicious organization members without validation in consuming contract code? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [State Corruption] Can Organizations[address] be set to null or default Organization after creation, allowing subsequent operations to treat a valid organization as non-existent and bypass authorization checks in consuming contracts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Collision Attack] Can an attacker predict or force hash collisions in organization address derivation to overwrite existing Organizations[address] entries, hijacking control of legitimate organizations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Race Condition] Can concurrent CreateOrganization calls with identical inputs lead to race conditions where Organizations[address] is overwritten, causing one organization to be silently replaced by another with potentially different members or thresholds? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Data Integrity] Is there missing validation ensuring Organizations[address].OrganizationAddress matches the mapping key address, allowing address mismatches that could cause authorization failures or enable cross-organization attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Reentrancy] Can reentrancy attacks during external contract calls modify Organizations[address] state mid-execution, causing TOCTOU (Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use) vulnerabilities where organization validation succeeds but state changes before use? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Missing Validation] Does the state mapping lack bounds checking on OrganizationMemberList size, allowing unbounded growth that could cause gas exhaustion DOS attacks when iterating members in validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Orphaned State] Can Organizations[address] entries become orphaned if proposal execution fails mid-transaction, leaving inconsistent state where organizations exist but associated proposals or resources are corrupted? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Missing Cleanup] Is there no mechanism to remove or archive Organizations[address] entries, allowing state bloat and potential enumeration attacks where attackers query all historical organizations to extract sensitive information? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Organizations] [Type Confusion] Can the MappedState generic typing be exploited if Organizations[address] is cast or accessed with incorrect type assumptions in consuming code, leading to memory corruption or type confusion vulnerabilities? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Proposal Hijacking] Can Proposals[proposalId] be overwritten by an attacker who generates a hash collision or exploits weak proposal ID generation to replace legitimate proposals with malicious ones before execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Double Voting] Does Proposals[proposalId] lack atomic update guarantees, allowing race conditions where multiple votes from the same address are recorded in Approvals/Rejections/Abstentions lists before duplicate checks execute? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [State Corruption] Can Proposals[proposalId] be partially initialized or corrupted if proposal creation fails mid-transaction, leaving proposals in invalid states that bypass validation checks in Release() operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Reentrancy] Can reentrancy during Approve/Reject/Abstain operations modify Proposals[proposalId].Approvals/Rejections/Abstentions concurrently, allowing double-counting of votes or bypassing the 'already voted' check? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Missing Expiry Enforcement] Does Proposals[proposalId] persist after ExpiredTime without automatic cleanup, allowing expired proposals to be approved and released if ClearProposal() is never called? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Unbounded Lists] Do Proposals[proposalId].Approvals/Rejections/Abstentions lists lack size limits, enabling DOS attacks where an attacker adds all organization members to approval lists, causing gas exhaustion when counting votes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Missing Validation] Can Proposals[proposalId].OrganizationAddress be set to a null or non-existent organization, allowing proposal release without proper authorization checks in consuming contract logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Deletion Vulnerability] After Proposals.Remove(proposalId) in Release(), can the same proposalId be reused if Token-based generation allows collisions, enabling replay attacks where old proposal parameters are re-executed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Cross-Organization Attack] Can Proposals[proposalId] be created with one OrganizationAddress but voted on by members of a different organization if validation doesn't verify voter membership against the proposal's specific organization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: Proposals] [Params Injection] Does Proposals[proposalId].Params lack integrity verification, allowing modification of proposal parameters between approval and release through state manipulation or reentrancy? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Fee Bypass] Can TransactionFees[methodName] be set to null or zero fees by exploiting missing authorization checks, allowing attackers to execute expensive operations without paying transaction fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Unauthorized Modification] Does TransactionFees[methodName] lack proper access control verification before updates, allowing any address to modify method fees if MethodFeeController validation is missing or bypassable? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Race Condition] Can concurrent SetMethodFee() calls create race conditions where TransactionFees[methodName] is overwritten, causing fee inconsistencies or allowing attackers to front-run fee changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Missing Validation] Does TransactionFees[methodName] allow negative or excessively high fees without bounds checking, enabling DOS attacks through prohibitively expensive operations or integer overflow in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/AssociationState.cs] [State Variable: TransactionFees] [Reentrancy] Can reentrancy during fee collection or token transfer modify TransactionFees[methodName] mid-execution, causing TOCTOU issues where fee amounts change between validation and collection? (High)"
