  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CurrentTermNumber] [Term Number Overflow] Could CurrentTermNumber overflow after many terms, wrapping to zero or negative, breaking all term-based calculations for profit periods, lock times, and snapshot storage? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: CurrentTermNumber] [Term Increment Race] Is there a race condition where multiple TakeSnapshot calls could increment CurrentTermNumber simultaneously, skipping terms and breaking snapshot consistency in the Snapshots mapping? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Candidates] [Duplicate Candidate Entry] Can a candidate's pubkey be added to the Candidates list multiple times through announce/quit/announce cycles, causing vote counting errors or allowing them to receive multiple subsidy shares? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Candidates] [Candidates List Pollution] Could an attacker add unlimited entries to the Candidates list through repeated announcements with different pubkeys, causing DoS through excessive iteration costs in snapshot or ranking calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Candidates] [Candidate Removal Race] When a candidate is banned or removed from Candidates list, is there a race condition where they could still receive votes or be included in DataCentersRankingList temporarily? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Candidates] [Candidates List Inconsistency] Can Candidates list become desynchronized with CandidateInformationMap, where a pubkey exists in one but not the other, breaking candidate validation logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: DataCentersRankingList] [Ranking Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate vote amounts in DataCentersRankingList to artificially inflate a candidate's ranking without corresponding entries in CandidateVotes, gaining subsidy benefits unfairly? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: DataCentersRankingList] [Data Center Slot Squatting] Could an attacker announce multiple candidates and strategically vote for them to occupy all validation data center slots in DataCentersRankingList, preventing legitimate candidates from receiving subsidies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: DataCentersRankingList] [Ranking List Overflow] If DataCentersRankingList is allowed to grow beyond GetValidationDataCenterCount(), does this cause accounting errors in subsidy distribution or allow more beneficiaries than intended? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: DataCentersRankingList] [Ranking Update Race] During vote changes, could race conditions cause DataCentersRankingList to have inconsistent vote amounts compared to CandidateVotes, leading to incorrect candidate replacements? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: DataCentersRankingList] [Negative Vote Amount] Can DataCentersRankingList contain negative vote amounts through underflow during withdrawals, breaking ranking comparisons and causing unexpected candidate replacements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialMiners] [Initial Miner Replacement] Can entries be added or removed from InitialMiners list after initialization, allowing an attacker to gain initial miner privileges or remove legitimate initial miners? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialMiners] [Initial Miner Announcement] Are initial miners in InitialMiners list properly prevented from announcing election, or can they bypass this check and gain unfair advantages like double subsidies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: InitialMiners] [Initial Miner Banning] When an initial miner from InitialMiners is banned, are all references properly updated, or can they still appear in miner lists and receive rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: BannedPubkeyMap] [Ban Evasion] Can a banned pubkey in BannedPubkeyMap be re-registered under a slightly different format (hex case, encoding) to bypass ban checks and participate in elections again? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: BannedPubkeyMap] [False Ban Attack] Could an attacker manipulate BannedPubkeyMap to falsely mark legitimate candidates as banned, preventing them from receiving votes or subsidies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: BannedPubkeyMap] [Ban Status Inconsistency] When a pubkey is banned in BannedPubkeyMap, are they simultaneously removed from Candidates, DataCentersRankingList, and CandidateInformationMap, or can inconsistent states allow continued participation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: BannedPubkeyMap] [Unban Vulnerability] Is there any way to remove a banned status from BannedPubkeyMap, and if so, is it properly controlled to prevent reinstating malicious candidates? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: LockTimeMap] [Lock Time Manipulation] Can lock times in LockTimeMap be modified after a vote is cast, allowing an attacker to decrease lock time and withdraw funds early or increase it to gain unfair vote weight? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: LockTimeMap] [Lock Time Underflow] During ChangeVotingOption with IsResetVotingTime=false, could the lock time subtraction in LockTimeMap underflow, wrapping to a huge positive value and locking funds indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: LockTimeMap] [Zero Lock Time] Can a vote be created with zero lock time in LockTimeMap, bypassing minimum lock requirements and allowing instant withdrawals while still claiming vote weight benefits? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: LockTimeMap] [Lock Time Collision] If two votes generate the same vote ID, could they share the same LockTimeMap entry, causing one voter's lock time to affect another voter's withdrawal eligibility? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: LockTimeMap] [Lock Time Not Removed] When votes are withdrawn, is the LockTimeMap entry properly removed, or can stale entries accumulate causing storage bloat and incorrect lock time checks on vote ID reuse? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Snapshots] [Snapshot Overwrite] Can an attacker trigger multiple TakeSnapshot calls for the same term number, overwriting legitimate snapshots in Snapshots mapping and corrupting historical election data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Snapshots] [Snapshot Injection] Could fake snapshots be injected into the Snapshots mapping for future terms, predefining election results before voting occurs? (Critical)"
