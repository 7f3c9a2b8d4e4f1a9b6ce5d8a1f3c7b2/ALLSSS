  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroReferenceState.cs] [Class: BasicContractZeroState] [Namespace Pollution] Since the class is in the AElf.Contracts.Genesis namespace, could an attacker deploy a malicious contract in the same namespace that interferes with these reference state properties through namespace-level access? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroReferenceState.cs] [Properties: All] [Upgrade Safety] If any of these referenced contracts (Parliament, Token, Consensus) are upgraded, could the reference states become stale and point to deprecated contract versions with known vulnerabilities? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Proposal Lifecycle] When BasicContractZero interacts with Parliament through this reference during contract code check proposals, could timing issues allow proposals to be executed before proper code review? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Allowance Exploitation] If contract deployment requires token allowances checked through TokenContract reference, could an attacker front-run deployment transactions to manipulate allowances and cause legitimate deployments to fail? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroReferenceState.cs] [Property: ConsensusContract] [Time Slot Manipulation] When BasicContractZero queries consensus time slots through ConsensusContract reference for deployment authorization, could miners manipulate timestamps to bypass time-based deployment restrictions? (Medium)"
