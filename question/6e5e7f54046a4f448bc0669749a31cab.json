  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Transfer Failure] If the Transfer call fails on line 79-86, is the state still removed on line 87, leading to permanent token loss for the user? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Virtual Address Security] Can an attacker manipulate the proposalId to transfer tokens from unintended virtual addresses controlled by other proposals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Premature Unlock] There is no check that the proposal has been released or expired - can voters unlock tokens immediately after voting, violating the locking mechanism? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Proposal State Validation] No validation that the proposal exists or is in a valid state for token unlock - can tokens be unlocked from invalid or deleted proposals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Amount Manipulation] The receipt.Amount is used directly without validation - can an attacker who compromised the receipt manipulate the unlocked amount? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Symbol Validation] There is no validation that receipt.TokenSymbol is valid or matches expected tokens - can corrupted receipts cause failed transfers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: UnlockToken()] [Double Unlock Prevention] After removal on line 87, can an attacker still access the receipt through other state mappings to attempt double unlocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Empty String Bypass] Line 92 checks string.IsNullOrEmpty but not whitespace-only strings - can an attacker create organizations with whitespace TokenSymbol to bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [ProposerWhiteList Empty Check] Line 93 uses ProposerWhiteList.Empty() - can an attacker create an organization with an empty whitelist, allowing no one to propose, causing DOS? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Token Existence Race] Line 95 calls GetTokenInfo which may pass initially but token could be invalidated later - can this create organizations with non-existent tokens? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Threshold Inequality] Line 98 requires MinimalApprovalThreshold <= MinimalVoteThreshold, but what if they're equal and both zero? Can proposals pass with no votes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Threshold Minimum] Line 99 requires MinimalApprovalThreshold > 0, but lines 100-101 allow MaximalAbstentionThreshold and MaximalRejectionThreshold to be 0 - can this create unbalanced voting mechanisms? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Integer Boundary] No check for maximum values of thresholds - can setting them to long.MaxValue cause arithmetic overflow in IsReleaseThresholdReached? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Threshold Relationship] No validation that MinimalVoteThreshold is greater than or equal to MaximalRejectionThreshold + MaximalAbstentionThreshold + MinimalApprovalThreshold - can inconsistent configurations make proposals impossible to pass? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Null Field Checks] Line 92 checks OrganizationAddress and OrganizationHash for null, but not for zero/default Address/Hash values - can these bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [ProposalReleaseThreshold Null] No explicit null check for proposalReleaseThreshold before accessing its fields on lines 98-101 - can this cause null reference exceptions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(Organization)] [Return Value Handling] The function returns false for validation failures but may Assert on line 95 - is error handling inconsistent? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Null vs Whitespace] Line 107 checks IsNullOrWhiteSpace for ContractMethodName but line 106 only checks != null for ToAddress - can whitespace-only method names pass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Expired Time Race] Line 108 checks Context.CurrentBlockTime < ExpiredTime, but can proposals expire between validation and execution, leading to execution of expired proposals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Zero Block Time] If Context.CurrentBlockTime returns zero or is manipulated, can the expiration check be bypassed to execute already-expired proposals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [OrganizationAddress Validation] Line 109 only checks that OrganizationAddress is not null, not that it's a valid/existing organization - can proposals reference non-existent organizations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [URL Validation Bypass] Line 110 calls ValidateDescriptionUrlScheme which may return true for empty strings - can proposals with missing URLs still pass validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Params Validation] No validation of proposal.Params field - can malformed or malicious params cause execution failures or exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [ToAddress Contract Check] No validation that ToAddress is actually a contract address - can proposals target non-contract addresses, causing execution failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: Validate(ProposalInfo)] [Method Existence] No validation that ContractMethodName exists on the ToAddress contract - can invalid method calls cause DOS or unexpected behavior? (Medium)"
