  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Batch Operation] Is there any limit on how many different method fees can be set in a single block, potentially allowing rapid configuration changes that users can't react to? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Accumulation] If a method has fees set multiple times with different token symbols, do the fees accumulate or replace, and can this be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Validation Timing] Is CheckOrganizationExist() called before or after state changes, and can this ordering be exploited for race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Circular Authority] Can input.OwnerAddress point to an organization that itself delegates authority back to the current controller, creating circular governance? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Return Value Mutation] Does returning State.TransactionFees[input.Value] directly expose the internal state to mutation by the caller? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Caching Issue] If fees are cached off-chain based on GetMethodFee() results, can race conditions cause users to pay incorrect fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Symbol Order] Does the order of symbols in the returned list matter for fee calculation, and can this order be manipulated? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Mixed Fee Sources] When combining method fees and size fees, if there's a conflict in fee amounts for the same symbol, which takes precedence? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Contract Name Trust] Is SmartContractConstants.ParliamentContractSystemName a compile-time constant, or can it be manipulated to point to a fake Parliament contract? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Double Initialization] Can RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() be triggered multiple times through different call paths, potentially resetting the controller? (Medium)"
