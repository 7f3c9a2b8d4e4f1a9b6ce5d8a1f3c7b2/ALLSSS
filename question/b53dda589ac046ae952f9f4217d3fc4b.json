  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Empty Symbol String] If input.Symbol is",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Null Symbol String] If input.Symbol is null, does GetAllProfitsMap pass null to ProfitAllPeriods, and how does that affect profit calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Whitespace Symbol] If input.Symbol contains only whitespace, do dictionary lookups treat it as distinct from empty/null symbols? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Unicode Symbol] If input.Symbol contains Unicode characters, can it cause encoding mismatches in dictionary key lookups? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Very Long Symbol] If input.Symbol is extremely long (10000+ characters), can it cause memory issues or DoS in TryGetValue operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Zero TotalShares] The sentinel value TotalShares = -1 (line 42) indicates non-existence. If a scheme legitimately has TotalShares = 0, can this cause division-by-zero in profit distribution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [Negative TotalShares] If TotalShares is negative (other than -1), can this cause incorrect profit per share calculations elsewhere? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [CurrentPeriod = 0] If scheme.CurrentPeriod is 0, does the filter on line 114 (LastProfitPeriod < CurrentPeriod) exclude all details? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Profit/ViewMethods.cs] [Edge Case] [CurrentPeriod Overflow] If scheme.CurrentPeriod approaches Int64.MaxValue, can period arithmetic fail or overflow in future calculations? (Low)"
