  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: GetContractInfo()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker enumerate all deployed contracts and their authors by iterating through addresses, potentially identifying high-value targets or contract relationships? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: GetContractAddressByName()] [Name Squatting] Can an attacker deploy a malicious contract with a name hash that collides with or resembles a system contract name, tricking users into interacting with the wrong contract? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ValidateSystemContractAddress()] [Fake System Contract] Can an attacker bypass system contract validation by registering a malicious contract with a name hash that matches a legitimate system contract's hash? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: GetSigner()] [Privacy Leak] Can an attacker discover signer relationships between addresses by querying GetSigner for all known addresses, revealing off-chain identity connections? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeUpdateContract()] [Version Rollback] Can an attacker update a contract to an older version by manipulating the version check in AssertContractVersion, potentially reintroducing previously patched vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: AssertContractVersion()] [Version Bypass] Can an attacker bypass the IsSubsequentVersion check by manipulating the SmartContractRegistration fields passed to Context.CheckContractVersion? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: UpdateSmartContract() in Helper] [Version Inconsistency] If Context.UpdateSmartContract returns contractInfo.IsSubsequentVersion as false but the assertion is somehow bypassed, can the contract be updated to an incompatible version causing runtime failures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeUpdateContract()] [Update Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker update Genesis contract (Context.Self) without going through proper authorization by exploiting the condition 'input.Address == Context.Self || info.SerialNumber > 0' that allows self-updates?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeUpdateContract()] [Compatibility Check Bypass] Can an attacker update a contract from one requiring ContractOperation (SerialNumber == 0) to one that doesn't, or vice versa, by manipulating the compatibility check at line 189-190? (High)",
