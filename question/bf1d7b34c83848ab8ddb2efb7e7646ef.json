  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Block Count Manipulation] ProducedBlocks and ProducedTinyBlocks at lines 71-72 are copied without validation - can these be inflated by the caller to falsely boost the miner's production statistics and claim undeserved rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [LIB Height Manipulation] Does copying ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight at line 73 without bounds checking allow a miner to set an arbitrary LIB height in tiny block headers, causing incorrect finality calculations or enabling double-spend attacks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Incomplete Round State] At line 79, empty MinerInRound objects are added for all other miners - does this cause validation failures because these miners have no Pubkey, Order, or other required fields set? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Consensus Verification Bypass] Can the empty MinerInRound objects at line 79 bypass consensus checks that expect all miners to have valid data, allowing tiny blocks to be accepted when they should be rejected? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Miner Count Mismatch] If the simplified round from GetTinyBlockRound has a different miner count than the actual round (due to empty objects at line 79), does this break consensus invariants that assume consistent miner counts across round updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Memory Waste] Does adding empty MinerInRound objects for potentially hundreds of miners at line 79 waste memory and bandwidth when serializing tiny block headers, enabling resource exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Missing Critical Fields] The tiny block round excludes OutValue, Signature, InValue, PreviousInValue, and secret sharing data - does this prevent proper validation of tiny blocks against the consensus protocol requirements? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound() vs GetTinyBlockRound()] [Inconsistent Behavior] GetUpdateValueRound includes partial data for other miners (lines 42-53) while GetTinyBlockRound adds empty objects (line 79) - does this inconsistency cause different validation behaviors for UpdateValue vs TinyBlock that can be exploited? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound() vs GetTinyBlockRound()] [Field Selection] GetUpdateValueRound includes OutValue, Signature, and PreviousInValue while GetTinyBlockRound excludes them - can this difference be exploited to publish consensus data in tiny blocks that should only appear in update value blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound() vs GetTinyBlockRound()] [Validation Gap] Both methods copy ProducedBlocks, ProducedTinyBlocks, and ActualMiningTimes but with different surrounding context - can a miner use one method instead of the other to bypass validation checks specific to each block type? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Mutable Return Value] The Round object returned at line 55 is mutable - can the caller modify it after receiving it to inject malicious data before it's used in consensus header generation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Mutable Return Value] The Round object returned at line 81 can be modified by the caller - can this enable post-generation tampering of tiny block consensus data before it's serialized into block headers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Shallow Copy] Does the method perform shallow copies of Hash objects and collection references at lines 23-28, allowing the caller to mutate the original Round's data through shared references after GetUpdateValueRound returns? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Collection Mutation] At line 70, ActualMiningTimes is copied using collection initializer - is this a deep or shallow copy, and can modifications to the returned round's ActualMiningTimes affect the original Round's state? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Secret Sharing Exposure] The simplified round excludes EncryptedPieces and DecryptedPieces fields that are present in MinerInRound - does this break secret sharing validation when the simplified round is used in consensus verification? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [InValue Omission] Current InValue is not included in the simplified round (only PreviousInValue at lines 27, 51) - can this omission cause validation failures when verifying consensus commands that depend on current InValue? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Signature Verification] Signature is copied at line 24 but the corresponding InValue that generated it is not included - does this prevent signature verification in the simplified round, allowing invalid signatures to pass validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [No Cryptographic Data] GetTinyBlockRound completely excludes OutValue, Signature, InValue, and PreviousInValue - does this mean tiny blocks have no cryptographic proof of participation in the consensus secret sharing protocol? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Missing Time Validation] ExpectedMiningTime is not included in the simplified round - does this prevent time-slot validation, allowing miners to produce blocks outside their assigned time windows? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Timestamp Manipulation] ActualMiningTimes at line 70 is copied without timestamp validation - can a miner claim they produced tiny blocks at times when they had no mining rights, breaking the time-slot consensus protocol? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [ActualMiningTimes Overflow] If ActualMiningTimes collection at line 28 contains thousands of entries from a miner who produced many blocks, does this cause serialization size limits to be exceeded when the simplified round is included in block headers? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Missing MissedTimeSlots] MissedTimeSlots field is not copied into the simplified round - does this prevent punishment mechanisms from detecting and penalizing miners who consistently miss their time slots? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [No Missed Slot Tracking] Tiny block rounds don't include missed time slot information - can a miner produce tiny blocks during missed slots to avoid punishment while still claiming block production rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Statistical Manipulation] ProducedBlocks at line 25 is copied without verifying it matches ActualMiningTimes count at line 28 - can a miner inflate ProducedBlocks while keeping ActualMiningTimes small to manipulate statistics? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Next Round Order Manipulation] SupposedOrderOfNextRound and FinalOrderOfNextRound at lines 38-40 are updated only for the target pubkey - can a miner manipulate these values to guarantee themselves favorable positions (like first or extra block producer) in the next round? (Critical)"
