  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Multiple Conflicts Edge Case] Line 29 comment says 'Multiple conflicts is unlikely' but doesn't prove impossibility - can an attacker craft multiple signature collisions to create multiple simultaneous conflicts breaking the resolution logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Conflict Resolution Non-Determinism] Lines 25-40 modify RealTimeMinersInformation during iteration - can this cause non-deterministic behavior where conflict resolution order affects final state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [maybeNewOrder Calculation Error] Line 33 calculates maybeNewOrder as (i > minersCount ? i % minersCount : i) - can this produce maybeNewOrder = 0 when i = minersCount, violating the assumption that orders are 1-indexed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Break Without Assignment] Line 38 breaks the loop after assignment - but if no available position is found (all positions occupied), does the conflicted miner keep their original conflicting FinalOrderOfNextRound causing duplicate orders? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Conflict Resolution State Corruption] Lines 28-40 iterate over conflicts list but modify RealTimeMinersInformation - can modifying the dictionary during iteration based on a stale conflicts list cause incorrect reassignments? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Gas Exhaustion via Repeated Calls] No rate limiting exists - can an attacker spam this function with valid pubkeys to exhaust gas/resources, preventing legitimate miners from submitting consensus data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [LINQ Query DOS] Lines 25-26 use LINQ Where() over all RealTimeMinersInformation - with a large miner set, can repeated calls cause quadratic gas consumption O(n²) where n is miner count? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Conflict Loop Gas Exhaustion] Lines 31-40 can iterate up to minersCount * 2 times per conflict - with multiple conflicts, can total gas consumption exceed block gas limit causing transaction revert? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [All() Predicate DOS] Line 34 calls All() over RealTimeMinersInformation.Values for each loop iteration - can this O(n²) operation in the worst case cause gas exhaustion when many positions are occupied? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Dictionary Access DOS] Multiple dictionary accesses on lines 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 36, 42, 44 - can an attacker cause excessive state reads by calling this repeatedly, increasing gas costs for legitimate miners? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Duplicate Order Assignment] If the conflict resolution fails to find an available position, can two miners end up with identical FinalOrderOfNextRound values, breaking next round's time slot uniqueness? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Order Continuity Break] Lines 42-44 set orders without ensuring all positions 1..minersCount are filled - can gaps in order sequence break next round generation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [VRF Chain Integrity] Lines 14-16 lock PreviousInValue but don't verify it matches previous round's OutValue - can broken VRF chain compromise random number generation security? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Signature-Order Binding] Line 19 derives order from signature, but signature is never verified - can this break the cryptographic binding between signature and order assignment? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Miner Set Consistency] Line 10 silently returns if pubkey not in RealTimeMinersInformation - can this allow consensus data submission timing attacks where attacker waits for specific miner set states? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Order Distribution Fairness] The order assignment algorithm favors miners who submit first - can this enable miner collusion where they coordinate submission order to monopolize favorable positions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Consensus Data Completeness] No check ensures all miners have submitted consensus data - can incomplete submissions cause next round generation to fail or produce invalid state?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_ApplyNormalConsensusData.cs] [Function: ApplyNormalConsensusData()] [Return Value Semantics] Line 46 returns 'this' (the modified Round object) - can external code incorrectly handle this reference causing unintended state sharing or mutations?
