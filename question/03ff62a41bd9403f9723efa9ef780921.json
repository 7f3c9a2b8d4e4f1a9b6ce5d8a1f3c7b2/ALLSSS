  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [DoS] If RealTimeMinersInformation contains a very large number of miners, can the nested foreach loops (lines 10, 13) consume excessive gas, causing block execution timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Storage Cost] Does this method reduce storage costs by clearing large byte arrays, or is the storage already paid and clearing provides no refund? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Caller Context] Is this method only called from GetConsensusBlockExtraData when isGeneratingTransactions=false, and if called from other contexts, does it break consensus state expectations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Side Effects] Do any event listeners or state observers depend on EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces remaining populated, causing failures when this method clears them unexpectedly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [View Function Impact] If GetRoundInformation or GetCurrentRoundInformation view methods are called after this method executes, do they return incomplete Round data missing secret pieces? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Serialization] Does clearing EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces affect the Round's protobuf serialization format in AElfConsensusHeaderInformation, potentially causing deserialization errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Cross-Chain] If this Round data is transmitted to side chains via CrossChain contract, does clearing secret pieces break side-chain consensus verification that expects complete Round information? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Determinism] If different nodes call this method at different times during consensus, can it cause non-deterministic Round state, breaking consensus agreement on block headers? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [LIB Calculation] Does clearing secret pieces affect ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight calculations that may depend on verifying all miners' contributions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Term Transition] During NextTerm behavior, if this method clears the previous term's last round data before term rewards are calculated, can it cause incorrect dividend distribution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Miner Punishment] If evil miner detection (MissedTimeSlots check) requires inspecting EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces to verify participation, does premature clearing prevent punishment enforcement? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Round Validation] Does CheckRoundTimeSlots() or other validation methods depend on secret pieces being present, causing validation failures after this method executes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Privacy] Before Clear() executes, are the EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces byte arrays logged or emitted in events, allowing observers to capture secrets before deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Secret Recovery] Can an attacker with access to blockchain state snapshots recover cleared EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces from previous block states, defeating the purpose of deletion? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Timing Leakage] Does the execution time of this method (proportional to miner count) leak information about the current miner set size to external observers? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Empty Round] If RealTimeMinersInformation is empty or null, do the Select operations on lines 9 and 12 throw exceptions or silently succeed with empty enumerables? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Partial Data] If some miners have EncryptedPieces but no DecryptedPieces (or vice versa), does this method handle the asymmetry correctly or cause enumeration mismatches? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Null Maps] If a MinerInRound has null EncryptedPieces or DecryptedPieces maps, will calling Clear() on line 10 or 13 throw NullReferenceException? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Exception Safety] If Clear() throws an exception on one miner's EncryptedPieces (line 10), are subsequent miners' data left uncleared, creating inconsistent partial deletion? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Idempotency] Is this method idempotent? If called twice on the same Round object, does it cause errors or safely handle already-cleared collections? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Header Bloat] Is this method necessary to prevent AElfConsensusHeaderInformation from exceeding maximum block header size limits when storing Round data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Optimization Bypass] Can an attacker craft a Round with minimal EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces such that clearing them provides no size benefit, but the method still consumes gas? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Size Calculation] Does the system verify that Round size after calling this method is within acceptable limits, or can oversized Rounds still be created if other fields are bloated? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Semantic Mismatch] Does the file name 'Round_GetLighterRound.cs' imply this method creates a lighter copy for transmission, but if it mutates the original Round object, does it violate immutability expectations?
