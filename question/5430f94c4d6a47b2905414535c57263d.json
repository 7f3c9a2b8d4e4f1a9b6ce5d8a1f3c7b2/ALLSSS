  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDeposit()] [Token Contract Failure] If State.TokenContract.GetBalance.Call fails or returns null at line 91, does the function handle it gracefully or throw an exception that DoSes the contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetSideChainIndexingFeeDeposit()] [Negative Balance] Can the balance returned from GetBalance be negative due to accounting errors, and if so, does calling code handle negative values correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Expired Request Bypass] The check at line 104 allows a new request if CurrentBlockTime>=ExpiredTime, but can an attacker repeatedly submit requests just as they expire to DoS the system? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Allowance Front-Running] The allowance check at line 108-113 reads current allowance, but can the proposer reduce allowance between this check and actual token transfer, causing the creation to fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Allowance Race] Can an attacker front-run the allowance check by calling approve(0) right before AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest executes, bypassing the validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Negative Price] The check at line 120 ensures IndexingPrice>=0, but does it validate a maximum price to prevent proposals with impossibly high indexing prices that lock excessive tokens? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Integer Overflow] If LockedTokenAmount is near MAX_LONG and IndexingPrice causes overflow in comparisons at line 121, can validation be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [IsPrivilegePreserved Bypass] If IsPrivilegePreserved=false at line 124, resource and token validations are skipped.

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Initial Issue Validation] The check at line 134-136 validates that amounts>0, but does it check for integer overflow when summing initial issue amounts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainCreationRequest()] [Sender vs Proposer] The function uses Context.Sender at line 103 but proposer parameter for allowance check.

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidResourceTokenAmount()] [Missing Resource Tokens] The loop at line 142-143 checks all required resource symbols exist with >0 amounts, but can an attacker provide extra unexpected resource tokens that aren't validated? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainTokenInfo()] [TotalSupply Overflow] The check at line 153 ensures TotalSupply>0, but does it validate against MAX_LONG to prevent overflow during token operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainTokenInfo()] [Symbol Length] Does the function validate symbol length and character restrictions, or can overly long/special symbols break token contract logic? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertValidSideChainTokenInfo()] [Name Validation] The check at line 150-151 uses !string.IsNullOrEmpty, but does it prevent whitespace-only or excessively long names? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.CrossChain/CrossChainContract_Helper.cs] [Function: TransferDepositToken()] [Virtual Inline Failure] If SendVirtualInline at line 166 fails, is the failure propagated to the caller, or does execution continue with tokens still locked? (Critical)",
