  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Dependency: ArrangeNormalBlockMiningTime()] If MiningTimeArrangingService.ArrangeNormalBlockMiningTime uses Max() between expected time and current time, but expected time is corrupted to be in far future, will all miners be forced to wait indefinitely? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Dependency: GetExpectedMiningTime()] If Round.GetExpectedMiningTime returns Timestamp with Seconds=long.MaxValue for non-existent miner, will AddMilliseconds cause overflow resulting in a negative or wrapped timestamp for MiningDueTime? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Dependency: GetMiningInterval()] If Round.GetMiningInterval calculates interval based on first two miners' times, but those times are identical or inverted, can it return 0 or negative interval breaking all timing calculations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Invariant: Round Progression] Can NormalBlockCommandStrategy be instantiated with a CurrentRound that has RoundNumber=1, violating the expectation that FirstRoundCommandStrategy should handle round 1? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Invariant: Miner Eligibility] Does the strategy verify that Pubkey has not exceeded their allowed block count or has been marked as evil/punished in CurrentRound before generating a mining command? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Invariant: Time Slot Uniqueness] If two miners have identical ExpectedMiningTime in CurrentRound due to data corruption, can both invoke NormalBlockCommandStrategy simultaneously creating a time slot collision? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Invariant: Round Completion] If CurrentRound indicates all miners have completed their time slots (all ActualMiningTime populated), should NormalBlockCommandStrategy still generate commands, or does this violate the invariant that round should transition? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Invariant: Previous Round Linkage] If _previousRoundId does not match the RoundId of the actual previous round in blockchain state, can this create a fork or inconsistency in round history? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [DoS: Infinite Mining Window] If MiningDueTime is calculated to be in the far future due to overflow or manipulation, can a miner hold their time slot indefinitely preventing subsequent miners from producing blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [DoS: Zero Block Limit] If DefaultBlockMiningLimit evaluates to 0 milliseconds due to division rounding or manipulated MiningInterval, will blocks fail to be produced entirely halting consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [DoS: Timestamp Exhaustion] If ArrangedMiningTime is set to Timestamp.MaxValue, will AddMilliseconds operations in subsequent logic overflow causing all time-based consensus logic to fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Consensus: Round Replay] Can a malicious node reuse the same previousRoundId for multiple rounds, creating duplicate hints that enable replay of consensus states from earlier rounds?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Consensus: Behaviour Enforcement] Is there verification that UpdateValue behaviour is appropriate for the current consensus state, or can miners force UpdateValue when NextRound or NextTerm should be used? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Consensus: Mining Order] Does the strategy verify that the miner is producing blocks in the correct order relative to other miners in the round, or can order be violated? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Edge Case: Single Miner] If CurrentRound contains only one miner, how does GetMiningInterval and time slot logic behave - can it create degenerate cases with zero intervals? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Edge Case: Maximum Miners] If CurrentRound contains the maximum allowed number of miners, can integer calculations for MiningInterval overflow or can performance degrade? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Edge Case: Round Boundary] If this method is called exactly at the boundary between rounds (CurrentBlockTime equals round transition time), which round's data is used and can this create ambiguity? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Edge Case: Leap Seconds] Can leap seconds in system time cause discrepancies between CurrentBlockTime and round ExpectedMiningTime values, breaking time slot synchronization?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Strategy Selection] If GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand is called multiple times on the same instance, are the results consistent, or can round state changes between calls produce conflicting commands?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Strategy Lifecycle] If the strategy instance is cached and reused across multiple blocks, can stale CurrentBlockTime or CurrentRound data lead to incorrect command generation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Data Type: RoundId] Can RoundId overflow if the blockchain runs for an extremely long time with many rounds, and would this break the hint encoding or round comparisons? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Data Type: Timestamp Precision] Are there precision loss issues when converting between Timestamp (seconds/nanos) and milliseconds in AddMilliseconds that could cause off-by-one errors in time slot boundaries?
