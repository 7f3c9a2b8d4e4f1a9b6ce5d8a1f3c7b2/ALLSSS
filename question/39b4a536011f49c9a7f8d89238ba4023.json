  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Cross-Contract] Can RemoveBeneficiary fail silently or revert, leaving the evil node's profit distribution active even after they are removed from the candidate list? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Event Manipulation] Can the EvilMinerDetected event be spoofed or replayed to falsely indicate evil miners, or can legitimate evil node detection be suppressed by transaction ordering? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Input Validation] Can RecentlyProducedBlocks or RecentlyMissedTimeSlots be negative values that would corrupt the cumulative counters when added? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMultipleCandidateInformation()] [DOS] Can an attacker cause the consensus contract to send an extremely large batch of UpdateCandidateInformationInput entries, causing the loop to consume excessive gas and fail, preventing batch updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMultipleCandidateInformation()] [Authorization] Does UpdateMultipleCandidateInformation allow only the consensus contract but not the emergency organization to call it, creating an asymmetry where emergency intervention cannot batch-update candidates? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMultipleCandidateInformation()] [State Inconsistency] If one UpdateCandidateInformation call in the loop fails or reverts, does the entire batch revert, or can partial updates leave the state inconsistent? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMultipleCandidateInformation()] [Business Logic] Can duplicate pubkeys in the input.Value list cause the same candidate to be updated multiple times with cumulative values, inflating their ProducedBlocks and MissedTimeSlots? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMinersCount()] [Input Validation] Can MinersCount be set to zero, breaking miner selection logic and causing consensus to fail when trying to elect miners? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMinersCount()] [Input Validation] Can MinersCount be set to an extremely large value (e.g., int.MaxValue), causing resource exhaustion in miner selection algorithms or subsidy distribution loops? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMinersCount()] [Business Logic] Can reducing MinersCount below the current number of active miners cause miners to be abruptly removed mid-term without proper cleanup of their voting records or profit shares? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMinersCount()] [Authorization] Is the authorization check comparing contract addresses sufficient, or can an attacker create a malicious contract and register it as the consensus contract before the legitimate one? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMinersCount()] [State Corruption] Does SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner correctly handle the case where DataCentersRankingList has more entries than the new MinersCount, or can it leave orphaned entries with active profit distributions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateMinersCount()] [DOS] Can rapidly changing MinersCount up and down cause SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner to be called repeatedly, consuming excessive gas and creating state churn? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIds()] [Authorization] Does SetTreasurySchemeIds lack any authorization check, allowing any address to set the treasury scheme IDs before they are initialized? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIds()] [Input Validation] Can TreasuryHash, WelfareHash, SubsidyHash, WelcomeHash, or FlexibleHash be set to null or zero hashes, breaking profit distribution logic that depends on valid scheme IDs? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIds()] [Hash Collision] Can duplicate hashes be provided for different schemes (e.g., TreasuryHash == WelfareHash), causing profit distributions intended for different schemes to merge incorrectly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIds()] [Business Logic] Does the single initialization check prevent updates to treasury scheme IDs even if they were set incorrectly, requiring contract redeployment to fix configuration errors? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetTreasurySchemeIds()] [State Corruption] Can SetTreasurySchemeIds be called before InitialElectionContract, setting treasury IDs in an uninitialized contract state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker manipulate the GetCandidateAdmin result to match their address, gaining permission to replace arbitrary candidate pubkeys? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Double Replacement] Can an attacker replace the same OldPubkey multiple times by calling ReplaceCandidatePubkey repeatedly before the first transaction completes, creating multiple NewPubkey entries pointing to the same OldPubkey? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [State Inconsistency] Can the NewPubkey already exist in InitialMiners but not in Candidates, causing the assertion 'New pubkey is already a candidate' to be bypassed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Logic Error] If OldPubkey is in DataCentersRankingList but AddBeneficiary or RemoveBeneficiary fails, can the replacement leave the profit contract with inconsistent beneficiary mappings? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Business Logic] Does banning OldPubkey at the end of the function prevent legitimate cleanup operations that might need to reference the old pubkey in the future? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [State Corruption] If PerformReplacement succeeds but subsequent state updates fail (e.g., updating DataCentersRankingList), can this leave the contract in an inconsistent state where replacement mappings are set but actual state variables are not updated? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [DOS] Can an attacker repeatedly replace pubkeys back and forth (A->B, B->A, A->B...), causing unbounded growth in the replacement mapping chain and making GetNewestPubkey increasingly expensive to compute?
