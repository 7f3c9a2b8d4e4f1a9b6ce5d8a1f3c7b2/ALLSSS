  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Modifier: static] [Thread Safety] Could static constant access cause race conditions in concurrent voting operations, or are const values guaranteed thread-safe? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Usage: AddOption] [TOCTOU] Is there time-of-check-time-of-use gap between checking 'votingItem.Options.Count < MaximumOptionsCount' and actually adding the option? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Usage: AddOptions] [Batch Validation] Does AddOptions validate each option length individually, or only check after batch insertion, allowing temporary OptionLengthLimit bypass? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Usage: Vote] [Runtime Check] Is OptionLengthLimit checked during Vote operation even for options already added, wasting gas on redundant validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Usage: RemoveOption] [Unnecessary Validation] Why does RemoveOption check OptionLengthLimit when removing existing options, potentially blocking removal of malformed data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Missing: MinimumOptionsCount] [Business Logic] Is there a minimum options count required for voting items, or can voting items be created with zero/one option, breaking voting integrity? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Missing: MinimumOptionLength] [Empty Options] Can empty strings or single-character options be added, potentially causing option collision or display issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Missing: DuplicateCheck] [Option Uniqueness] Is duplicate option prevention enforced before length check, or can near-identical 1024-byte options bypass deduplication? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Type: int] [Negative Values] Could constants be compiled/interpreted as negative integers through type confusion, causing validation bypass? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Type: int vs long] [Overflow] If option counts are stored as long but MaximumOptionsCount is int, could integer overflow occur in comparison operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Error Message] [Information Leak] Do error messages referencing VoteContractConstants.MaximumOptionsCount provide attackers exact validation thresholds for exploitation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Error Message] [Inconsistency] Are error messages consistent in how they reference these constants, or could inconsistent messaging indicate validation gaps? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Cross-Contract] [Election Contract] Does Election contract respect VoteContractConstants limits, or could it bypass limits through direct state manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Cross-Contract] [Governance] Can Parliament/Referendum/Association contracts create voting items exceeding these limits through privileged operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Upgrade] [Backward Compatibility] If constants change in contract upgrade, do existing voting items with 64 options become invalid or grandfathered? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Upgrade] [Migration] Could reducing MaximumOptionsCount in future versions brick existing voting items exceeding new limit? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Economics] [Fee Structure] Are transaction fees proportional to option count/length, or can attackers exploit flat-fee model with maximum-size options? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteContractConstants.cs] [Economics] [Storage Rent] If storage rent is implemented later, could 64×1024-byte voting items become economically unsustainable? (Low)"
