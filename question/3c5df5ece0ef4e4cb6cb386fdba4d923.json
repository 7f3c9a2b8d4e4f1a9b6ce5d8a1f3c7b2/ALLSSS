  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Integer Overflow] If organizationMembers_.Count exceeds int.MaxValue through repeated AddMember calls, could Count() return negative values or wrap around, breaking threshold validation logic in Validate() that checks MinimalVoteThreshold <= organizationMemberCount? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Race Condition] If Count() is called during concurrent AddMember/RemoveMember operations in a multi-threaded context, could it return stale member counts causing IsReleaseThresholdReached to incorrectly evaluate proposal approval status? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Logic Error] Does Count() account for duplicate addresses in organizationMembers_ list, and could attackers exploit AddMember to add the same address multiple times to inflate the count and bypass MinimalApprovalThreshold checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [State Inconsistency] If organizationMembers_ is modified directly outside of AddMember/RemoveMember (e.g., via reflection or unsafe operations), could Count() return values inconsistent with actual governance power distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [DOS] Could an attacker add millions of members to make Count() operations extremely expensive, causing proposal validation in Validate() to timeout or consume excessive gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [Validation Bypass] If Count() returns 0 for a newly created but uninitialized organizationMembers_ field, could this bypass the Empty() check in Validate() and allow creation of organizations with no members? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Logic Error] Does Empty() correctly handle null vs. zero-length organizationMembers_ lists, and could a null list bypass the Empty() validation check in Validate() allowing memberless organizations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Race Condition] If Empty() is checked in Validate() while RemoveMember is executing concurrently, could the organization become empty between the Empty() check and state commit, violating the 'never empty' invariant? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Validation Bypass] Since Empty() only checks Count() == 0, could an organization with members that all have null/invalid addresses pass the Empty() check but fail to function for proposal approval? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [State Transition] If RemoveMember removes the last member, Empty() becomes true, but does the subsequent Validate() call prevent this, or could the last member removal succeed and freeze the organization permanently? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [Initialization] For newly created organizations before any members are added, does Empty() return true, and could this allow proposals to be created on empty organizations before CreateOrganization validates membership? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Authorization Bypass] Does Contains() perform case-sensitive or normalized address comparison, and could attackers use address variations to bypass AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember checks in Approve/Reject/Abstain? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Null Reference] If Contains() is called with a null address parameter, does it throw an exception or return false, and could this be exploited to bypass membership checks if null addresses exist in the list? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [DOS] If organizationMembers_ contains millions of members, does Contains() perform a linear search causing O(n) complexity that could make Approve/Reject operations prohibitively expensive? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Duplicate Handling] If the same address appears multiple times in organizationMembers_ (despite AnyDuplicate validation), does Contains() return true on first match, and could this affect vote counting in IsProposalRejected/IsProposalAbstained? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Race Condition] If Contains() is called during AddMember/RemoveMember execution, could it return inconsistent results causing legitimate members to be denied voting rights or non-members to vote? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Address Validation] Does Contains() validate that the input address is well-formed before searching, or could malformed addresses cause exceptions that DOS the approval/rejection flow? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [Zero Address] If Contains() is called with Address.Zero or default(Address), does it correctly return false, or could zero addresses in the member list cause false positives allowing unauthorized voting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [AddMember Integration] When AddMember adds a duplicate address, does Count() increment even though AnyDuplicate() should fail in Validate(), and could the ordering of checks allow temporary count inflation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [AddMember Integration] After AddMember adds a new member but before state commit, does Contains() immediately return true, and could reentrancy during this window allow double-voting on proposals? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [AddMember Integration] If an empty organization is created (bypassing validation), could AddMember be called to add the first member without proper initialization of proposal thresholds? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Count()] [RemoveMember Integration] When RemoveMember removes a member, does Count() decrement immediately, and could this cause MinimalApprovalThreshold validation to fail for in-flight proposals if member count drops below threshold? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [RemoveMember Integration] If RemoveMember removes a member who has already voted on a proposal, does Contains() correctly return false for vote recounting, preventing the removed member's vote from counting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Empty()] [RemoveMember Integration] When RemoveMember removes the last member, Empty() returns true, but does Validate() in RemoveMember prevent this, or could all members be removed leaving a zombie organization? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/OrganizationMemberList.cs] [Function: Contains(Address address)] [RemoveMember Integration] If RemoveMember is called with an address not in the list, does Contains() help validate this before Remove() is called, or does the contract rely solely on Remove() return value? (Low)"
