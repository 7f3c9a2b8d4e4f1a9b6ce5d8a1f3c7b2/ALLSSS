  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Information Leakage] Can the pattern of successful vs failed queries across all view methods reveal internal state structure and voting activity patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Query Optimization] Can an attacker craft queries that trigger worst-case performance in LINQ operations (Where, Select, First) causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Null Handling Inconsistency] Why does GetVotedItems return empty object for null but GetVotingResult and GetLatestVotingResult return null - can this cause inconsistent error handling? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Error Information] Do assertion messages on lines 23 and 30 provide too much information about internal state to potential attackers? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Multiple Functions] [State Size] If voting records, items, or results grow unbounded, can queries return excessively large data structures causing network or memory issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingRecords] [Batch Query Attack] Can an attacker craft input.Ids containing all possible hash combinations to enumerate the entire voting record space? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotedItems] [Address Enumeration] Can systematically querying all possible addresses reveal which addresses have voting activity, compromising privacy? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingRecord] [Forensic Analysis] Can historical voting records be queried indefinitely after voting completes, enabling long-term voter surveillance? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingItem] [Configuration Exposure] Does exposing ticket_cost, is_quadratic, and is_lock_token enable attackers to identify voting items vulnerable to specific exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingResult] [Front-Running] Can querying current voting results enable malicious actors to front-run final votes based on current tallies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetLatestVotingResult] [Real-Time Monitoring] Can continuous polling of latest results combined with GetVotingRecords enable identification of who voted when? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingIds] [Correlation Attack] Can combining GetVotingIds with GetVotingRecords enable tracking of all votes cast by a specific address across all voting items? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingRecords] [Withdrawn Data] Does returning withdrawn voting records violate data retention policies or allow tracking of vote changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotedItems] [Complete History] Does exposing both active_votes and withdrawn_votes in VotedItems enable complete reconstruction of voting behavior including mistakes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingResult] [Statistical Analysis] Can querying voting results for multiple snapshots enable statistical deanonymization of voters in small voting groups? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingResult] [Hash Computation Consistency] Does VotingResult.GetHash() on line 40 use the same algorithm as the hash computation in Vote() and TakeSnapshot(), or can mismatches cause data not found? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetLatestVotingResult] [Hash Algorithm] Is the GetHash() method on line 51 collision-resistant, or can an attacker find inputs that hash to existing voting result keys? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingIds] [String Key Security] Does using input.VotingItemId.ToHex() as a dictionary key on line 57 introduce any hash collision or key collision vulnerabilities? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingResult] [Deterministic Hashing] Is the hash computation deterministic across all nodes, or can variations cause different nodes to return different voting results? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Hash Enumeration] Can an attacker precompute hash collisions for common voting patterns to access or manipulate voting data? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Functions] [Gas Manipulation] Can an attacker submit queries that consume excessive gas relative to useful work, attacking node economics? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Functions] [RPC Amplification] Can a single query trigger retrieval of megabytes of data, enabling RPC amplification attacks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingRecords] [Unbounded Loop] Does the Select operation on line 11 lack iteration limits, enabling DoS via massive input.Ids arrays? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [GetVotingIds] [LINQ Complexity] Can the Where().Select().First() chain on lines 57-58 have O(n) complexity that becomes expensive for voters with many voting items? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Functions] [State Read Costs] Do all these methods incur the same gas cost regardless of data size, or can attackers exploit cost asymmetries? (Low)"
