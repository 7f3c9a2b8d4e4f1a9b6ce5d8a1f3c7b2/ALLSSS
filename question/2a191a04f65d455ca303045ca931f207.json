  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Loop Overflow] In the loops at lines 97 and 109, if CurrentSymbolNumberLength or newSymbolNumberLength is very large, can the loop iterations cause gas exhaustion or integer overflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Return Value Inconsistency] Does the function always return a consistent value for concurrent callers, or can the return values at lines 112 and 115 differ if state changes during execution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GetCurrentNumberLength()] [Flag Doubling Logic] Is the flag.Mul(2) calculation at line 103 intended to track how many symbols have been created, and can an attacker manipulate symbol creation patterns to cause incorrect length transitions?
