  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: CheckOrganizationExist()] [Method Name String] The nameof operator at line 70 references AuthorizationContractContainer.AuthorizationContractReferenceState.ValidateOrganizationExist - can an attacker exploit contracts that don't implement this exact method name? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [State Consistency] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee and ChangeMethodFeeController in the same block, exploiting state inconsistencies between the controller check and fee updates? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [Initialization Race] Can an attacker exploit the fact that RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet is called from multiple functions (lines 14, 23, 41), causing race conditions during initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [View Function Side Effects] GetMethodFeeController at line 41 calls RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet which modifies state - can an attacker exploit this to initialize the controller through a view function call?
