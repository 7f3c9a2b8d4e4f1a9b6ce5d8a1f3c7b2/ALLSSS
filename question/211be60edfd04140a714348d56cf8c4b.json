  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Negative Amount] The check at line 80 only validates amount >= 0 - can an attacker pass amount = 0 to effectively disable fees for that token, violating fee collection requirements? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Integer Overflow] Can an attacker pass an amount value that is negative due to integer overflow but still passes the >= 0 check at line 80, later causing underflows in fee calculations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Token Contract Trust] If State.TokenContract is compromised or malicious, can it return true for IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee() for invalid tokens, allowing fees to be set in tokens that break the economic model? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Lazy Initialization Race] Can multiple concurrent calls trigger the lazy initialization at lines 81-83 simultaneously, causing State.TokenContract.Value to be set multiple times with potentially different values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Symbol Validation] Is there any validation that symbol is not null, empty, or contains invalid characters before calling IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee at line 85? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Reentrancy] Can the TokenContract perform a reentrancy attack during the IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee call at line 85, modifying state before AssertValidToken returns? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Call Failure] If IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee call fails or throws an exception at line 85, will the entire transaction revert, potentially creating a DOS condition if the TokenContract is unavailable? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Token Whitelist Changes] If a token's availability status changes between AssertValidToken() validation and actual fee collection, can this cause fee payment failures for users? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [State Race] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee() and ChangeMethodFeeController() in quick succession to set malicious fees before the controller is changed, locking in bad fee configurations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Initialization Exploit] Can calling GetMethodFeeController() before any other function to force initialization give an attacker control over the timing of when the default Parliament organization is queried? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Controller Migration] If the controller needs to be migrated to a new organization, what prevents the old controller from setting malicious fees right before the migration completes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Circular Dependency] Can the Economic contract and Parliament contract create circular dependencies during initialization, causing deadlock or initialization failure? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Fee Override] Can SetMethodFee() be called repeatedly for the same method to override fees without any rate limiting or event emission, enabling silent fee manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Multiple Functions] [Default Fees] If GetMethodFee() returns null for methods that have never had fees set, how does the broader system handle fee collection for these methods - is there a default, or do they become free? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Controller Compromise] If the controller organization's approval threshold is lowered or members are compromised, can malicious actors set zero fees or extremely high fees to attack the economic system? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Governance Lock] Can the controller intentionally set itself to an organization that can never approve proposals, permanently locking the controller and preventing any future fee changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Multi-Step Attack] Can an attacker first compromise the Parliament default organization, then trigger RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() initialization, and finally use the compromised organization to change the controller? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Economic Attack] Can the controller set extremely high fees for critical functions (e.g., token transfers, cross-chain operations) to effectively DOS the entire blockchain by making transactions unaffordable? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Discrimination] Can the controller set discriminatory fees that favor certain tokens or methods, creating unfair economic advantages or manipulating specific contract behaviors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Partial Update] If the transaction runs out of gas during the foreach loop at line 13, can this result in partial fee validation where some tokens are validated but State.TransactionFees is never updated? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Atomic Override] When State.TransactionFees[input.MethodName] is overwritten at line 17, is the previous value completely replaced atomically, or could there be a moment where the state is inconsistent?
