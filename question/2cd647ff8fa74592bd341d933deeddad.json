  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: Both GetHash methods] [Upgrade Safety] If VotingRegisterInput or VotingResult protobuf definitions are upgraded with new fields, will existing hashes remain valid, or will hash mismatches break voting item lookups? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingRegisterInput, Address)] [Upgrade Safety] If the Options field type changes from one collection type to another during a contract upgrade, will Clear() still work correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingRegisterInput, Address)] [Resource Management] Does the cloned VotingRegisterInput object get properly disposed after hashing, or could memory accumulation from repeated cloning cause node instability? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingResult)] [Resource Management] Does creating a new VotingResult object for each hash computation cause excessive object allocation, impacting transaction throughput during high-volume voting periods? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingResult)] [Timestamp Exclusion] By excluding timestamps from VotingResult hash, can an attacker claim a voting result from one time period represents results from another period? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingRegisterInput, Address)] [Signature Bypass] If VotingRegisterInput contains sponsor signature fields, does clearing Options before hashing break signature verification of the complete voting item including options? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingRegisterInput, Address)] [DOS] Can an attacker submit VotingRegisterInput with deeply nested object hierarchies or recursive structures that cause Clone() or HashHelper.ComputeFrom() to consume excessive CPU/memory? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: GetHash(VotingResult)] [DOS] Can rapid repeated calls to GetHash(VotingResult) with varying inputs cause hash collision search patterns that degrade performance for legitimate voting result verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/VoteExtensions.cs] [Function: Both GetHash methods] [DOS] Could extremely large VotingRegisterInput or VotingResult objects (within blockchain size limits) cause hash computation to exceed transaction gas limits? (Medium)"
