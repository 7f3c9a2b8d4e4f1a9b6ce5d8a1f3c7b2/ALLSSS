(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Hardcoded Special Case] Does the hardcoded check for ReleaseApprovedUserSmartContract at line 37 create a security hole where only this one method gets IsSizeFeeFree=true, and can attackers exploit similar method names? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Self-Referential Fee] Can SetMethodFee be called to set fees for itself (input.MethodName = 'SetMethodFee'), and does this create a circular dependency or lockout scenario? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Controller Self-Reference] Can input.ContractAddress be set to the current contract address (BasicContractZero), making the controller reference itself and breaking the authority model?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Partial Update] If the foreach loop at line 11 fails on the Nth iteration (e.g., invalid token), are the previous N-1 validations rolled back or do they leave partial state changes? (Medium)",

(Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Atomic Update] Is the State.MethodFeeController.Value update at line 28 atomic, or can reads between line 25's validation and line 28's write see inconsistent state? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Symbol Uniqueness] Does the foreach loop at line 11 check that Symbol values in input.Fees are unique, or can duplicate symbols cause ambiguous fee configurations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Method Existence] Does the function verify that input.MethodName corresponds to an actual callable method, or can arbitrary strings be used as keys in State.TransactionFees?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Reasonableness] Does the function enforce maximum fee limits to prevent OwnerAddress from setting economically prohibitive fees that effectively disable critical functions?
