  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass SetMethodFee authorization by directly modifying State.TransactionFees through a malicious contract call before MethodFeeController is initialized, allowing unauthorized fee structure changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Authorization Bypass] If State.TransactionFees[methodName] is set to null or empty MethodFees, can this be exploited to execute expensive methods with zero fees, bypassing all fee charging mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker set State.TransactionFees with an extremely large MethodFees.Fees collection causing ChargeTransactionFees to exceed gas limits and freeze all transactions for that method? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Accounting Error] Can State.TransactionFees be configured with duplicate symbols in the Fees list, causing GetBaseFeeDictionary to sum fees incorrectly and overcharge users? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Fee Manipulation] Can State.TransactionFees[methodName].IsSizeFeeFree be set to true for critical methods like Transfer or Burn, allowing attackers to spam large transactions without size fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Race Condition] If State.TransactionFees is modified mid-transaction execution, can this create inconsistent fee charging where GetMethodFee returns different values at different stages? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Integer Overflow] Can State.TransactionFees store BasicFee values that when summed in GetBaseFeeDictionary cause long overflow, resulting in negative fee amounts or zero fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Fee Evasion] If State.TransactionFees is not set for a method, does ChargeTransactionFees skip base fee charging entirely, allowing free execution of potentially expensive operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Symbol Manipulation] Can State.TransactionFees be set with non-existent or malicious token symbols, causing GetMethodFee to return invalid fee configurations that break fee charging logic? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Privilege Escalation] After MethodFeeController is changed via ChangeMethodFeeController, can the old controller still modify State.TransactionFees due to missing state cleanup? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [Time Manipulation] Can State.LastPayRentTime.Value be manipulated to an earlier timestamp during PayRental, causing excessive rental charges by artificially inflating the duration calculation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [Initialization Bug] If State.LastPayRentTime.Value is null on first DonateResourceToken call, does PayRental correctly initialize it, or can subsequent calls exploit uninitialized state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [Accounting Error] When State.LastPayRentTime is updated with duration.Mul(60), can integer overflow occur for extremely long durations, causing LastPayRentTime to wrap around and break rental calculations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker repeatedly call DonateResourceToken to force State.LastPayRentTime updates at high frequency, causing timestamp inconsistencies or rental calculation errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [Time Drift] If Context.CurrentBlockTime moves backward (chain reorganization), can State.LastPayRentTime.Value become greater than CurrentBlockTime, causing negative duration and rental calculation failures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [Rental Evasion] Can State.LastPayRentTime be set to CurrentBlockTime repeatedly to keep duration at zero, preventing any rental charges from being applied? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [Precision Loss] When calculating duration as (CurrentBlockTime - State.LastPayRentTime.Value).Seconds.Div(60), can precision loss from integer division allow rent evasion for durations under 60 seconds? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: LastPayRentTime] [State Corruption] If State.LastPayRentTime is modified directly without going through PayRental, can this corrupt rental accounting and allow side chains to avoid payment indefinitely? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [Authorization Bypass] Can State.SideChainCreator.Value be set multiple times by exploiting the 'Creator already set' assertion check, allowing an attacker to hijack side chain ownership? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [Null Reference] If State.SideChainCreator.Value is null when PayRental executes, does it return early safely, or can this be exploited to avoid rental charges entirely? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [Fund Theft] Can State.SideChainCreator be set to an attacker's address, allowing them to receive all rental payments meant for the legitimate creator? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [Privilege Escalation] Does State.SideChainCreator.Value grant special privileges like SetFeeReceiver, and can this be exploited if the creator address is compromised? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [Rental Balance Drain] When PayRental charges State.SideChainCreator, can the creator's balance be drained to zero repeatedly without debt forgiveness, causing permanent rental debt accumulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [Authorization Check] Is SetSideChainCreator properly checking Context.Sender against ZeroSmartContractAddress and Parliament, or can malicious contracts bypass this by impersonating these addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContractState_ChargeFee.cs] [State: SideChainCreator] [State Immutability] Since State.SideChainCreator can only be set once, is there a recovery mechanism if set to a lost or compromised address, potentially bricking the side chain? (Medium)"
