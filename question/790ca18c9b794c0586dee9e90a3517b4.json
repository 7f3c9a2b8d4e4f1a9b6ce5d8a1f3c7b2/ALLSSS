  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [State Consistency] This validator is called only for UpdateValue behaviour per line 82 of AEDPoSContract_Validation.cs. If NextRound or TinyBlock behaviours also modify LIB values, does skipping this validation for those cases allow LIB inconsistencies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Validation Order] This provider is added after MiningPermissionValidationProvider and TimeSlotValidationProvider. If earlier validators pass but LibInformationValidationProvider fails, is there state rollback, or could partial state changes from previous validators persist? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Missing Context] The function receives validationContext but doesn't validate that baseRound and providedRound are from the same term. Can cross-term LIB comparisons cause incorrect validation results? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Timestamp Validation] LIB validation checks heights and round numbers but not timestamps. If providedRound's LIB refers to a future block (based on timestamp), can this cause consensus instability? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Cross-Chain] If this is a side chain, does LIB validation ensure the ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight doesn't exceed the parent chain's indexed height, or can side chains claim LIB heights beyond parent chain knowledge? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 14] The condition checks providedRound.ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight != 0. What if ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight is negative? Does C# long allow negative values to pass this check and bypass validation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 15] The condition checks providedRound.ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockRoundNumber != 0. If RoundNumber is 1 (genesis round), does this validation incorrectly pass for genesis blocks that should have special handling? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 16] Uses strict greater-than (>). If baseRound and providedRound have equal LIB heights but providedRound is stale by other metrics (e.g., older timestamp), does this validation incorrectly pass? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 17] Second part of OR checks ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockRoundNumber. Can the round number legitimately decrease in certain consensus scenarios (e.g., term transition), causing false positives? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 23] ContainsKey check means non-miner pubkeys bypass validation. If pubkey is of a recently removed miner, can they exploit outdated providedRound data where they still exist? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 24] Checks if ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight != 0. What if a miner legitimately has ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight = 0 during chain initialization? Does this cause validation to skip when it shouldn't? (Low)",

If baseRound is from an older term where pubkey wasn't a miner, this throws KeyNotFoundException. Is this a DOS vector? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Line 26] The comparison checks if baseRound implied LIB > providedRound implied LIB. Should it also validate that providedRound implied LIB <= providedRound confirmed LIB for consistency? (Medium)",

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Type Safety] All LIB heights use long type. If other parts of the codebase cast these to int or uint, could truncation or sign issues cause validation to pass with incorrect values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Comparison Logic] Lines 16-17 use OR for two conditions. If only one condition is true (e.g., height regressed but round number didn't), validation fails. Is this the intended invariant, or should both need to regress? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Boundary Values] If ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight equals long.MaxValue in baseRound, can providedRound never advance LIB higher, effectively freezing finality?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Numerical Stability] The validation performs direct comparisons (>, <) without epsilon tolerance.
