  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedProposer()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker bypass proposer authorization by exploiting the null organization check before whitelist validation, allowing proposal creation with a crafted organization address that returns null but doesn't trigger the assertion? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedProposer()] [Race Condition] If ProposerWhiteList is modified between the assertion check and actual proposal creation, can an attacker create proposals after being removed from the whitelist, violating the authorization invariant? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedProposer()] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker cause DOS by creating an organization with an extremely large ProposerWhiteList (e.g., millions of addresses), making the Contains() check gas-exhaustive for legitimate proposers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedProposer()] [Logic Error] Does the Contains() method perform case-sensitive or case-insensitive address comparison, potentially allowing bypass through address case manipulation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedProposer()] [Data Integrity] If State.Organizations returns a corrupted or partially initialized organization object (non-null but with null ProposerWhiteList), can this cause a null reference exception or bypass the whitelist check? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker vote on proposals by exploiting organizations with empty OrganizationMemberList that still pass this check through Contains() returning false but not throwing? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember()] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker create organizations with millions of members to make Contains() operations gas-prohibitive, preventing legitimate members from voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember()] [Logic Error] If OrganizationMemberList contains duplicate addresses (despite validation), could this cause double-counting in vote threshold calculations when combined with Contains() checks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertIsAuthorizedOrganizationMember()] [Null Reference] What happens if organization parameter is null or OrganizationMemberList is null - does this throw before the Contains() check or allow unauthorized access? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsReleaseThresholdReached()] [Logic Error] Can an attacker manipulate vote counts to make IsProposalRejected return true and IsProposalAbstained return false, causing the function to incorrectly return false even when approval threshold is met? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsReleaseThresholdReached()] [Threshold Bypass] If MaximalRejectionThreshold is set to organizationMemberCount, can a single rejection block proposal release even with unanimous approval from all other members? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsReleaseThresholdReached()] [Short-Circuit Logic] Does the early return when isRejected is true prevent valid proposals from being released if rejection threshold is reached but approval threshold is also exceeded? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsReleaseThresholdReached()] [Race Condition] Can an attacker vote, trigger release check, then quickly revote to change their vote status before the proposal is actually released, bypassing threshold validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsReleaseThresholdReached()] [Logic Error] If both isRejected and isAbstained are false, but CheckEnoughVoteAndApprovals returns false, does this correctly prevent release or is there a code path that bypasses this check? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalRejected()] [Integer Overflow] Can proposal.Rejections.Count() overflow if an attacker adds billions of rejection addresses (if allowed), causing incorrect comparison with MaximalRejectionThreshold? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalRejected()] [Vote Counting Error] Does Count(organization.OrganizationMemberList.Contains) correctly handle duplicate addresses in Rejections list - could duplicates inflate rejection count? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalRejected()] [Threshold Logic] Should the comparison be > (greater than) or >= (greater than or equal) - can an attacker exploit edge case where rejectionMemberCount exactly equals MaximalRejectionThreshold? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalRejected()] [Non-Member Vote Counting] If proposal.Rejections contains addresses not in OrganizationMemberList, are these silently ignored or do they cause unexpected behavior in Count()? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalRejected()] [Negative Threshold] Can MaximalRejectionThreshold be negative, causing the comparison to always return false and allowing rejected proposals to pass? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalRejected()] [Empty List Edge Case] If OrganizationMemberList is empty, does Contains() always return false, making rejectionMemberCount always 0 regardless of rejections? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalAbstained()] [Integer Overflow] Can proposal.Abstentions.Count() overflow with extremely large abstention lists, causing incorrect threshold comparison? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalAbstained()] [Vote Counting Error] If Abstentions list contains duplicate member addresses, does Count() count them multiple times, inflating abstention count? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalAbstained()] [Threshold Logic] Should comparison be > or >= - can proposals with abstentionMemberCount exactly equal to MaximalAbstentionThreshold still be released? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalAbstained()] [Non-Member Vote Counting] Are abstentions from non-members correctly filtered by the Contains() check or could this cause issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Association/Association_Helper.cs] [Function: IsProposalAbstained()] [Negative Threshold] Can MaximalAbstentionThreshold be set to negative values, causing abstained proposals to incorrectly pass? (High)"
