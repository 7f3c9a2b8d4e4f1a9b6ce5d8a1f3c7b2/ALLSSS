  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: SetMaximumMinersCount()] [Type Safety] Is Int32Value.Value properly validated to be a valid int32, or can protobuf deserialization allow out-of-range values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: SetMinerIncreaseInterval()] [Type Safety] Is Int64Value.Value for the interval properly validated, or can it be negative/overflow when cast to int in calculations? (Medium)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: GetAutoIncreasedMinersCount()] [Leap Seconds] Are .Seconds calculations affected by leap seconds or timezone issues that could cause miner count inconsistencies? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Invariant: MinersCount >= SupposedMinersCount] [Business Logic] Can GetMaximumMinersCount() ever return a value less than SupposedMinersCount (17), violating the minimum viable consensus requirement? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Invariant: Controller Uniqueness] [State Consistency] Is there any guarantee that State.MaximumMinersCountController and State.MethodFeeController don't point to the same organization, causing governance confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Invariant: Monotonic Growth] [Business Logic] Can MinerIncreaseInterval changes cause miners count to decrease suddenly, violating expectations of monotonic growth? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Invariant: AEDPoS-Election Sync] [Integration] Is there any mechanism ensuring State.MaximumMinersCount and Election contract's miners count remain synchronized after SetMaximumMinersCount()? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: All] [Upgrade Safety] If the contract is upgraded, can State.MaximumMinersCount, State.MinerIncreaseInterval, or State.MaximumMinersCountController become corrupted or uninitialized? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_MaximumMinersCount.cs] [Function: RequiredMaximumMinersCountControllerSet()] [Migration] If the contract is deployed on a chain where Parliament doesn't exist yet, can this cause initialization failures? (Medium)",
