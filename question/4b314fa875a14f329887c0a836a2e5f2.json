  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [State Deletion] Can an attacker call SetMethodFee() with empty input.Fees array to effectively delete method fees? Would this make the method free or cause fee collection to fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: All Functions] [State Recovery] If State.MethodFeeController.Value becomes corrupted (null ContractAddress, invalid OwnerAddress), is there recovery mechanism or does this permanently brick fee management? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Single Point of Failure] Line 15 check requires Context.Sender == State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress. If OwnerAddress private key is compromised, attacker has full fee control with no multi-sig or timelock protection. Is this intended? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Governance Bypass] Can current controller at line 24 immediately change to new controller without proposal, voting, or timelock? Could compromised controller instantly transfer control to attacker address? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee() + ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Authorization Escalation] If an attacker gains temporary access to controller OwnerAddress, can they change controller to their permanent address via ChangeMethodFeeController() before access is revoked? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Information Disclosure] Line 52 returns full AuthorityInfo including OwnerAddress. Could exposing controller address enable targeted social engineering or key compromise attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Economic Attack] Can controller set fees to astronomical values (e.g., BasicFee = long.MaxValue - 1) for critical methods like token transfers to effectively DOS the entire chain? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Economic Attack] Can controller set fees to zero for expensive computational methods, enabling attackers to spam those methods and DOS the chain through resource exhaustion? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Manipulation] Can controller set different fees for same method at different times, front-running users by raising fees before their transactions execute and lowering after? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Token Validation] If State.TokenContract.IsTokenAvailableForMethodFee() only checks token existence, can controller set fees in illiquid or manipulated tokens where fee collection fails or can be gamed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Multi-Token Fees] Can input.Fees contain multiple different tokens for same method? How is fee payment handled - all tokens required or any one? Could this create payment confusion or collection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Validation] Is there validation that input.MethodName actually exists in any contract? Can attacker set fees for non-existent methods causing state bloat or collection system confusion? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Event] No event emission at line 16 after State.TransactionFees update. Could this enable stealth fee manipulation undetectable by off-chain monitoring? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Missing Event] No event emission at line 28 after State.MethodFeeController update. Could this enable stealth controller changes undetectable by governance systems? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Timelock] Line 16 immediately applies fee changes. Should critical fee updates have timelock period so users can exit before price changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Missing Multi-Sig] Line 28 allows single-address controller change. Should controller transitions require multi-sig approval or additional security measures? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Rate Limit] Can SetMethodFee() be called unlimited times per block? Could rapid fee changes cause confusion, front-running opportunities, or state bloat? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: All Functions] [Missing Pause Mechanism] Is there emergency pause mechanism if controller is compromised? Could runaway attacker cause irreversible damage before governance responds? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Fee Bounds] AssertValidToken() only validates >= 0, no maximum. Should there be reasonable upper bounds to prevent economic DOS attacks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [Contract Dependency] Lines 76-78 get TokenContract address by name. What if SmartContractConstants.TokenContractSystemName resolves to wrong address due to naming conflicts or malicious registration? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Contract Dependency] Line 67 assumes Parliament contract exists and responds correctly. What if Parliament contract is not initialized, causing RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() to fail and brick all fee management? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Contract Dependency] CheckOrganizationExist() likely calls external contracts. If those contracts are upgraded maliciously, could they approve invalid controllers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertValidToken()] [External Call] Line 80 makes external call to TokenContract. Is there reentrancy guard? Could malicious token contract exploit callback to manipulate fee state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [External Call] Line 66 calls Parliament contract. If Parliament contract is compromised, could it return attacker's address as default organization, giving attacker immediate fee control? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZeroContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Storage Collision] State.TransactionFees mapping uses input.MethodName as key. Are there hash collision risks if method names are similar or crafted maliciously? (Low)"
