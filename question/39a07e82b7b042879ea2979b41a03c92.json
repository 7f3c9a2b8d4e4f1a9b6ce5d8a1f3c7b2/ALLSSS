  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Timestamp Validity] If StartTimestamp > EndTimestamp due to bugs in Register() validation, does GetVotingItem() expose this invalid state without warnings? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Snapshot Timestamps] If SnapshotStartTimestamp or SnapshotEndTimestamp are corrupted (e.g., zero, far future), does GetVotingResult() return this invalid temporal data without validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Vote Timestamp] If VoteTimestamp in a record is before the voting item's StartTimestamp or after EndTimestamp, does GetVotingRecord() expose this time-travel anomaly indicating bugs in Vote() validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Vote Correlation] Can attackers combine GetVotingRecord() results with GetVotedItems() to correlate votes across multiple voting items, deanonymizing voters through voting pattern analysis? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Voter Profiling] Does returning complete voting history for any address enable comprehensive voter profiling, including political preferences, wealth levels (via amounts), and participation patterns? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingIds()] [Participation Tracking] Can GetVotingIds() be used to track which voters participated in specific voting items, enabling targeted influence campaigns or coercion? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Amount Validity] If a VotingRecord.Amount is negative or exceeds reasonable bounds due to integer overflow in Vote(), does GetVotingRecord() expose this invalid amount without validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Vote Count Accuracy] If VotersCount doesn't match the actual number of unique voters due to bugs in UpdateVotingResult() or Withdraw(), does GetVotingResult() return this inconsistent count without detecting the mismatch? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingResult()] [Votes Amount Integrity] If VotesAmount doesn't equal the sum of all Results values due to arithmetic bugs, does GetVotingResult() expose this accounting error without validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingItem()] [Currency Validation] If AcceptedCurrency is set to an invalid or non-whitelisted token symbol, does GetVotingItem() expose this configuration error that could prevent voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Token Lock Correlation] Can attackers use GetVotingRecord() to determine exact lock amounts and combine this with blockchain token transfer data to correlate voter identities? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Change Target Flag] What security implications does the IsChangeTarget field have, and does GetVotingRecord() properly expose this flag for vote change detection, or could it hide vote manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Methods] [Timing Side Channel] Do these view methods have consistent execution time regardless of whether data exists, or can attackers use timing differences to infer information about state without explicit queries? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Methods] [Error Message Leakage] Do assertion failures and exceptions expose detailed error messages that leak internal state information, enabling attackers to refine their queries and enumeration attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [All Methods] [State Size Leakage] Can the size of returned objects (e.g., number of options in VotingItem, number of votes in VotedIds) leak information about voting activity levels or participation rates? (Low)"
