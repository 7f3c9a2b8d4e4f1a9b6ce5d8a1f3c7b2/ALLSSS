  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Container State Corruption] Can the ParliamentContractContainer.ParliamentContractReferenceState be corrupted through memory manipulation or serialization attacks, causing governance bypass? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Container State Corruption] Can TokenContractContainer.TokenContractReferenceState be manipulated to bypass fee requirements or cause incorrect token operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Reference Overwrite] Can an attacker exploit race conditions during contract initialization to overwrite ParliamentContract reference with a malicious address before it's properly set? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Reference Overwrite] Can concurrent initialization calls cause TokenContract reference to be set multiple times, potentially to different addresses, creating state inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Deserialization Attack] Can an attacker manipulate serialized state data to inject a malicious contract address into ParliamentContract during state restoration or contract upgrade? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Deserialization Attack] Can malicious serialized state data override TokenContract reference with an attacker-controlled contract address during state migration? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Partial Class: ConfigurationState] [State Persistence Failure] If partial class state isn't properly persisted across transactions, can ParliamentContract and TokenContract references be lost, requiring reinitialization and potentially allowing injection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Authorization Bypass via Reference Swap] Can an attacker swap ParliamentContract reference mid-transaction to bypass authorization checks in ChangeConfigurationController or SetConfiguration operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationReferenceState.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Fee Bypass via Reference Swap] Can an attacker temporarily replace TokenContract reference with a contract that always returns success for fee operations, bypassing actual fee payment? (Critical)"
