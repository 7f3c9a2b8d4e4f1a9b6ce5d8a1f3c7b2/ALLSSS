  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Vote Manipulation] Does replacing a candidate pubkey preserve their vote count exactly, or can vote amounts be manipulated during the replacement process? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Cross-Contract] If the Vote contract's RemoveOption or AddOption calls fail or revert, can this leave the old option active while the new option is also added, allowing double voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Business Logic] Does the code correctly handle the case where OldPubkey is in InitialMiners, where RemoveOption and AddOption are not called? Can this create a scenario where initial miners cannot be voted for after replacement? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [State Corruption] Can removing CandidateSponsorMap[oldPubkey] before checking if the sponsor relationship is valid cause loss of sponsorship funds or break sponsor tracking? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Input Validation] Can OldPubkey and NewPubkey be the same value, causing the function to ban a pubkey that should remain active? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Business Logic] Does updating ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap only for Context.Sender mean that if admin changes, the old admin still has the pubkey in their managed list? (Low)",

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidateProfitsReceiver()] [Authorization] Does ReplaceCandidateProfitsReceiver lack authorization checks, allowing it to be called directly by an attacker to manipulate profit receiver mappings? (Critical)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: PerformReplacement()] [DOS] Can an attacker bypass the initial miner check and call RemoveOption/AddOption for initial miners, potentially removing critical voting options? (High)",
