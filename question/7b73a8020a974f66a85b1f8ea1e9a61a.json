  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Nanos Addition Overflow] If code adds to MaxValue.Nanos (999999999), can overflow to 1000000000 occur without proper Seconds increment, creating invalid timestamps? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Seconds Subtraction Underflow] When subtracting from MinValue.Seconds (-62135596800L), can underflow beyond long.MinValue occur in duration calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Semantic Mismatch] Does the comment '0001-01-01T00:00:00Z' accurately represent the intended minimum date, or should voting have a more recent minimum (like blockchain genesis) to prevent historical manipulation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Semantic Mismatch] Is year 9999 a reasonable maximum for blockchain operations, or should MaxValue be chain-specific (e.g., 100 years from genesis) to prevent far-future exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Equality Comparison] When comparing timestamps against MinValue/MaxValue using ==, does Nanos field get included, or can Nanos=1 vs Nanos=0 break boundary checks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Less-Than Comparison] In voting time window validation (StartTimestamp < currentTime < EndTimestamp), can incorrect operator precedence or Nanos handling allow votes outside [MinValue, MaxValue]? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Greater-Than Edge Case] When checking if currentTimestamp > MaxValue, does the comparison account for Nanos=999999999 such that adding even 1 nanosecond properly exceeds MaxValue? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Storage Amplification] Do voting records with [MinValue, MaxValue] timestamps consume more storage due to the extreme values, enabling storage exhaustion attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Query Performance] Can queries filtering on voting periods with [MinValue, MaxValue] bounds cause database index inefficiencies leading to DOS? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Iteration Complexity] If code iterates timestamp ranges from MinValue to MaxValue, can the ~8000-year span cause infinite loops or timeout DOS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Gas Cost Anomaly] Do timestamp operations with extreme MinValue/MaxValue values consume more gas than normal timestamps, enabling gas-based DOS attacks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Fee Calculation Impact] When method fees are calculated based on voting period duration, can [MinValue, MaxValue] cause fee overflow or underflow? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Block Timestamp Validation] Do consensus rules reject blocks with timestamps < MinValue or > MaxValue, or can miners produce blocks outside valid time ranges? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Genesis Block Timestamp] If genesis block has timestamp near MinValue, can this cause issues with time-delta calculations assuming positive elapsed time? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Chain Longevity] Does using MaxValue (year 9999) as upper bound create technical debt for a blockchain that might need to operate beyond this date? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [State Migration] If TimestampHelper values change in future versions, how are existing voting records with old MinValue/MaxValue migrated without breaking state consistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Snapshot Consistency] When voting snapshots are taken at different timestamps within [MinValue, MaxValue], can extreme timestamp differences cause snapshot drift or inconsistencies? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Leap Year Boundary] Does MinValue (year 1) and MaxValue (year 9999) correctly handle leap year calculations, or can Feb 29th edge cases cause timestamp validation failures? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Daylight Saving Time] Although timestamps are UTC (Z suffix), can DST-related timezone conversions in external systems misinterpret MinValue/MaxValue? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Year 1 AD Calendar] Is year 0001 correctly handled given that ISO 8601 year 0 doesn't exist in AD/BC calendar system, potentially causing off-by-one errors? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue + MaxValue] [Vote Weight Calculation] When vote weights are time-weighted using [MinValue, MaxValue] bounds, can the infinite duration cause weight overflow making recent votes worthless? (Critical)",
