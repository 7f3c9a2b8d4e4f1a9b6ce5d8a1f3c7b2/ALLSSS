  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Liveness Guarantee] If all miners have OutValue null and HandleMinerInNewRound() returns Nothing for all, does consensus permanently halt with no miner able to produce blocks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Byzantine Resistance] If Byzantine miner provides false CurrentRound state to constructor at line 26, can this cause honest miners using ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase to make incorrect consensus decisions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Time Synchronization] If miners' currentBlockTime at line 33 is significantly skewed due to clock differences, can _isTimeSlotPassed yield different results for same global state, breaking consensus? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Block Production Fairness] The extra block producer gets up to (maximumBlocksCount + blocksBeforeCurrentRound) blocks at lines 74-79 - is this fair, or can it centralize block production to a single miner? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Round Transition Safety] If GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound() at line 82 is called by multiple miners simultaneously, can this cause double round transition or round number skipping? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Denial of Service] If attacker fills ActualMiningTimes with maximum allowed entries, can the LINQ Count() operation at line 65 consume excessive gas/resources and DoS consensus? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Protocol] [Miner Exclusion] If legitimate miner's OutValue is null and their time slot has passed (_isTimeSlotPassed true), line 114 returns Nothing - does this permanently exclude the miner from current round? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Inheritance] [Abstract Method Override] GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound() at line 122 is abstract - can malicious derived class implement this to always return TinyBlock and never terminate rounds? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Inheritance] [Protected Field Access] CurrentRound is protected at line 24 - can derived classes modify CurrentRound between GetConsensusBehaviour() calls to manipulate behaviour selection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Inheritance] [Constructor Chain] If derived class doesn't call base constructor properly at lines 26-37, can this leave fields uninitialized and cause null reference errors? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Inheritance] [Virtual Method Injection] If GetConsensusBehaviour() at line 39 is not sealed/final, can derived class override it to bypass all validation logic and return arbitrary behaviours? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Inheritance] [Private Field Shadowing] If derived class shadows private fields like _isTimeSlotPassed, can this cause base class logic to use incorrect values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Input Validation] [Pubkey Format] The _pubkey parameter at line 31 has no format validation - can non-hex or wrong-length pubkey cause crashes in RealTimeMinersInformation lookup at line 36? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/ConsensusBehaviourProviderBase.cs] [Input Validation] [Timestamp Range] The currentBlockTime parameter at line 33 has no range validation - can extremely large or small timestamps (e.g., year 1970 or 9999) break time slot calculations?
