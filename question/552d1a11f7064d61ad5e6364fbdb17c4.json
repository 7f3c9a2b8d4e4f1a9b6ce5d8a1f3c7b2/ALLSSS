  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RemoveEvilNode()] [Double Removal] Can RemoveEvilNode be called twice for the same pubkey, causing UpdateCandidateInformation to fail the second time or create inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Mainteinence.cs] [Function: RemoveEvilNode()] [Input Validation] Can invalid hex strings in input.Value cause Address.FromPublicKey to fail, reverting the transaction before the candidate/miner checks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner()] [Business Logic] Can GetValidationDataCenterCount return an incorrect value based on stale state, causing the wrong number of data centers to be removed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner()] [Integer Underflow] Can rankingList.DataCenters.Count.Sub(validDataCenterCount) underflow if validDataCenterCount is greater than the current count, causing incorrect removal logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner()] [Logic Error] Does OrderBy(x => x.Value).Take(diffCount) correctly identify the lowest-ranked data centers, or can data centers with equal values cause non-deterministic removal? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner()] [State Corruption] If RemoveBeneficiary fails for any data center in the loop, does the entire operation revert, or can partial removals leave inconsistent state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner()] [DOS] Can an attacker cause diffCount to be extremely large by manipulating DataCenters or MinersCount, making the loop consume excessive gas? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner()] [Business Logic] Does removing data centers from the ranking list also remove their votes and candidate status, or can they remain as candidates without subsidy eligibility? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetProfitsReceiver()] [Authorization] Does the authorization check only allow TreasuryContract to call this function, preventing the emergency organization or governance from updating profit receivers? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetProfitsReceiver()] [Business Logic] If input.CandidatePubkey is not in DataCentersRankingList, the function returns Empty. Can this allow setting profit receivers for non-eligible candidates through race conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetProfitsReceiver()] [Logic Error] Does the beneficiaryAddress default to Address.FromPublicKey when PreviousReceiverAddress is empty correctly handle cases where the pubkey is invalid or has been replaced? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetProfitsReceiver()] [State Corruption] If RemoveBeneficiary succeeds but AddBeneficiary fails, can this leave the candidate with no profit receiver, causing their rewards to be lost? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetProfitsReceiver()] [Input Validation] Can input.ReceiverAddress be the zero address, causing profits to be permanently lost? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: SetProfitsReceiver()] [Business Logic] Does the early return when beneficiaryAddress == input.ReceiverAddress prevent legitimate updates when the address needs to be refreshed or re-registered? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Authorization] Does the authorization check only verify that the sender is AEDPoSContract, allowing any contract to be registered as the consensus contract and take snapshots? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Reentrancy] Can an attacker exploit reentrancy during the State.VoteContract.TakeSnapshot.Send call to manipulate voting records before the snapshot is finalized? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Integer Overflow] Can input.TermNumber.Add(1) overflow if TermNumber is at long.MaxValue, corrupting the CurrentTermNumber? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Business Logic] Does the function properly handle the case where ProfitContract is null, returning Empty without taking a snapshot, which would break profit distribution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Cross-Contract] If State.VoteContract.TakeSnapshot.Send fails or reverts, does the CurrentTermNumber still get incremented, causing term number misalignment? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [DOS] Can an attacker cause GetPreviousTermMinerPubkeyList to return an extremely large list, making the foreach loop consume excessive gas and fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [State Corruption] If UpdateCandidateInformation fails for any miner in the loop, does the entire snapshot operation revert, or can partial updates corrupt candidate statistics? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Business Logic] Can symbolList.Value be empty, causing amountsMap to be empty and DistributeProfits to fail or distribute zero rewards? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: TakeSnapshot()] [Logic Error] Does distributing zero amounts for SubsidyHash and WelfareHash serve any purpose, or can this be exploited to increment distribution periods without actual payouts? (Low)",
