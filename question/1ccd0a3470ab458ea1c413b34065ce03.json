  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: ConnectorController] [Contract Address Mismatch] Can ConnectorController.Value.ContractAddress point to a different contract than OwnerAddress expects, causing authorization checks to fail or be bypassed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: MethodFeeController] [Unused Controller Risk] Since MethodFeeController is declared but never accessed in contract code, can this create authorization gaps if ACS1 method fee logic attempts to use it? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: All States] [Reentrancy via State Reads] Can external contract calls (TokenContract.Transfer, DividendPoolContract.Donate) during Buy/Sell/HandleFee read stale state values if those contracts call back into TokenConverter before state updates complete? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: All States] [State Migration Risk] During contract upgrades, can state variable layout changes (reordering, adding, removing) corrupt existing Connectors/DepositBalance/FeeRate data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: Connectors + DepositBalance] [Atomic State Update Failure] Can Buy/Sell fail to atomically update both Connectors state and DepositBalance state, causing desynchronization if transaction reverts after partial update? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: BaseTokenSymbol + Connectors] [Symbol Namespace Collision] Can BaseTokenSymbol.Value collide with a Connector symbol key, causing ambiguity in which balance source to use in GetSelfBalance()? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: FeeRate + DepositBalance] [Fee Accounting Gap] If FeeRate changes between Buy calculation and HandleFee execution, can the fee deducted from user not match the fee added to DepositBalance, creating accounting holes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: TokenContract Reference] [Contract Upgrade Attack] If TokenContract address is upgradeable, can an attacker upgrade it to a malicious implementation that returns false balances or allows unauthorized transfers during Buy/Sell? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: ParliamentContract Reference] [Governance Takeover] If ParliamentContract address can be manipulated, can an attacker replace it with controlled contract to approve malicious proposals for changing ConnectorController? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: DividendPoolContract Reference] [Fee Diversion Attack] If DividendPoolContract.Value can be changed after initialization, can an attacker redirect all fee donations from HandleFee to their own contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: Connectors] [Weight String Injection] Can Connector.Weight string contain malicious characters (e.g., format specifiers, unicode, null bytes) that cause decimal.Parse() to behave unexpectedly in GetWeight()? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: Connectors] [Symbol Length Attack] Can extremely long Connector.Symbol strings cause storage DOS or excessive gas consumption when used as MappedState keys? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: DepositBalance] [Negative Balance Persistence] If DepositBalance[symbol] somehow becomes negative (through underflow bug), does it persist across transactions enabling unlimited withdrawals via Sell? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: ConnectorController] [Default Controller Immutability] Once GetDefaultConnectorController() sets ConnectorController.Value, can it be changed back to null or default state, potentially locking governance? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: FeeRate] [Culture-Specific Parsing] Since FeeRate uses InvariantCulture for ToString but GetFeeRate() uses default decimal.Parse, can culture differences cause parsing failures or value corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: Connectors] [Connector Deletion Gap] Is there any method to delete Connectors[symbol] entries, and if not, can zombie connectors accumulate indefinitely causing storage bloat? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: All MappedStates] [Key Enumeration Attack] Can an attacker enumerate all keys in Connectors/DepositBalance mappings to discover private connector configurations or hidden balances? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: BaseTokenSymbol + FeeRate] [Initialization Order Dependency] If FeeRate is accessed before BaseTokenSymbol is initialized, can this cause unexpected behavior in fee calculations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: Connectors] [Pair Connector Asymmetry] Can one connector in a pair (resource vs deposit) have IsPurchaseEnabled=true while its pair has IsPurchaseEnabled=false, causing one-way trading exploits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContractState.cs] [State: DepositBalance] [Reserve Draining via Migration] In MigrateConnectorTokens(), can improper DepositBalance[newSymbol] = DepositBalance[oldSymbol] copying allow an attacker to drain reserves by exploiting symbol transition? (High)"
