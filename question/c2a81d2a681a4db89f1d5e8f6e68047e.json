  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Missing Input Validation] Can an attacker call GetUpdateValueRound with a non-existent pubkey causing KeyNotFoundException at line 13 when accessing RealTimeMinersInformation[pubkey], potentially crashing consensus header generation and blocking block production? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Authorization Bypass] Does GetUpdateValueRound lack caller authorization checks allowing any miner to generate simplified rounds for other miners' pubkeys, potentially enabling unauthorized consensus data manipulation or privacy leaks of other miners' OutValue/Signature data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [State Integrity] If RealTimeMinersInformation dictionary is empty when GetUpdateValueRound is called, does the method fail gracefully or throw unhandled exceptions that could DOS consensus operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Null Reference] Can minerInRound retrieved at line 13 ever be null if the dictionary contains the key but the value is null, causing NullReferenceException when accessing minerInRound.OutValue at line 23? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Data Consistency] If pubkey exists in RealTimeMinersInformation but some of its fields (OutValue, Signature, PreviousInValue) are null or Hash.Empty, does copying them at lines 23-27 preserve invalid state that could break consensus validation later? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Consensus Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit the fact that RoundIdForValidation is set to RoundId at line 17 but RoundNumber at line 16 might not match, creating inconsistent round identifiers that bypass validation in RecoverFromUpdateValue? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Data Leakage] Does copying OutValue and Signature at lines 23-24 expose cryptographic secrets in the simplified round that should remain private until the reveal phase, enabling other miners to predict consensus outcomes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Block Production Manipulation] Can ProducedBlocks and ProducedTinyBlocks counts at lines 25-26 be manipulated by the caller before GetUpdateValueRound is invoked, allowing a miner to falsely inflate their production statistics in the consensus header? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [LIB Height Manipulation] Does copying ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight at line 29 without validation allow a malicious miner to set an arbitrary LIB height in their simplified round, potentially causing incorrect finality decisions or chain reorganization vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [ActualMiningTimes Integrity] At line 28, ActualMiningTimes is copied using collection initializer - if the source collection contains timestamps far in the future or past, does this violate time-slot validation invariants and enable time-based consensus attacks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Logic Error] In the loop at lines 35-53, why does the if-branch at lines 36-41 update SupposedOrderOfNextRound and FinalOrderOfNextRound only for the target pubkey when information.Key == pubkey, given that this miner's data was already added at lines 20-32? Is this duplicate handling that could cause state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Order Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate SupposedOrderOfNextRound or FinalOrderOfNextRound values at lines 38-40 before they are copied, enabling them to control their mining position in the next round and potentially monopolize block production? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Incomplete Data] For other miners in the else-branch at lines 42-53, only limited fields (Pubkey, orders, PreviousInValue) are copied - does this incomplete information cause validation failures when the simplified round is used in RecoverFromUpdateValue or consensus verification? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [PreviousInValue Exposure] Copying PreviousInValue at line 51 for all other miners reveals their previous round secrets - can this be exploited to predict or manipulate their current round InValue generation, breaking the secret sharing protocol? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Extra Block Producer Flag] IsExtraBlockProducer flag is copied at lines 31 and 50 - if this flag is incorrectly set, can a miner claim extra block production rights in the simplified round, bypassing the normal round rotation and producing unauthorized blocks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Miner List Tampering] Does the simplified round at lines 14-55 include all miners from the original RealTimeMinersInformation, or could the loop skip some miners, causing the simplified round to have a different miner set that fails consensus validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Order Consistency] Are the Order values copied at lines 30 and 49 guaranteed to be consistent with the miner list, or can Order collisions occur if two miners have the same Order value, breaking the mining schedule? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Dictionary Modification] If RealTimeMinersInformation is modified concurrently while the loop at lines 35-53 iterates over it, can this cause a ConcurrentModificationException or inconsistent state in the returned simplified round? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Memory Exhaustion] If RealTimeMinersInformation contains thousands of miners, does creating a new Round with all miner entries at lines 14-55 consume excessive memory, enabling a DOS attack by adding many miners to inflate memory usage? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [State Integrity] If RealTimeMinersInformation is empty when GetTinyBlockRound is called, does the method fail gracefully or produce a broken simplified round with only the target miner? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Consensus Manipulation] Is RoundIdForValidation set correctly at line 64 for tiny blocks, or can mismatched RoundId/RoundNumber allow tiny blocks to be validated against the wrong round, bypassing consensus rules? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [ActualMiningTimes Manipulation] At line 70, ActualMiningTimes is copied directly - can a malicious miner insert fake timestamps before calling GetTinyBlockRound, claiming they produced tiny blocks at times when they shouldn't have mining rights?
