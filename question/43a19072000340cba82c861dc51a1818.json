  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing Context.Sender Check] Does SetMethodFee() lack any validation of Context.Sender, allowing any address including EOAs to call it? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Missing Context.Sender Check] Does ChangeMethodFeeController() lack validation of Context.Sender against current controller's OwnerAddress? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Missing OnlyOwner Modifier] Do the write methods lack an owner/admin check pattern (Context.Sender == State.Owner.Value) that's common in other contracts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Missing AssertSenderAddressWith Helper] Does ChangeMethodFeeController() not use the AssertSenderAddressWith(address) helper pattern to validate caller authorization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Reentrancy During State Update] If SetMethodFee() were implemented with state writes, could an attacker use reentrancy to call SetMethodFee() again mid-execution before state is finalized? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Controller Reentrancy] If ChangeMethodFeeController() wrote to state, could reentrancy allow an attacker to change controller twice in one transaction? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Non-View State Read] Is GetMethodFee() marked as view-only in protobuf but performs string operations that could theoretically be optimized away in a proper implementation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [View Method Instantiation] Does GetMethodFeeController() unnecessarily instantiate a new AuthorityInfo object on each call instead of returning a cached value? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [Stub Implementation Risk] Are these stub implementations intentional placeholders for future development, or production code that should be functional, creating deployment risk? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [Testing Coverage Gap] Can integration tests pass with these stub implementations because they return success (Empty), hiding the fact that no actual functionality exists? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Silent Failure Pattern] Does returning Empty() instead of throwing exceptions create a silent failure pattern where errors go unnoticed? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_ACS1.cs] [Function: All Methods] [Documentation Mismatch] Do XML comments or external documentation describe ACS1 behavior that doesn't match the actual stub implementations? (Low)"
