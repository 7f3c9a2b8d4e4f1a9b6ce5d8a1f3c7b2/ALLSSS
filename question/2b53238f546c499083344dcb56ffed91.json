(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Inheritance] Does MiningInterval from base class get recalculated on each access, and can CurrentRound state changes cause it to return different values during single command generation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Data Integrity] Is the returned ConsensusCommand immutable, or can fields be modified after creation, allowing command tampering before consensus processing?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Signature] Is the ConsensusCommand cryptographically signed or MACed to prevent tampering, or can any party modify the command in transit?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Edge Case] What happens if CurrentRound.RealTimeMinersInformation is empty, causing GetExpectedMiningTime and GetMiningInterval to fail or return invalid values?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Edge Case] If CurrentRound contains only one miner, does GetMiningInterval return a valid value, or does this cause division by zero or special-case handling? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Edge Case] Can GetExpectedMiningTime return Timestamp with Seconds=0, and would this be interpreted as Unix epoch, causing mining time to be set to 1970? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Edge Case] If Pubkey matches multiple entries in RealTimeMinersInformation (duplicate miners), which expected mining time is used, and can this cause mining schedule ambiguity? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Edge Case] What if CurrentRound.RoundNumber is zero or negative, indicating an uninitialized or corrupted round, should command generation be blocked?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/NormalBlockCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Edge Case] If previousRoundId is long.MaxValue, can this indicate a wraparound condition, and does this cause issues with round progression tracking?
