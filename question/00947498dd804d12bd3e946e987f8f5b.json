  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Clock Drift] If different miners have significant clock drift, can this cause them to generate conflicting consensus commands for round termination? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Data Consistency] Can the ConsensusCommand object be modified after creation but before validation, allowing attackers to change the Behaviour hint from NextRound to NextTerm? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Data Consistency] Is the ArrangedMiningTime value validated against the MiningDueTime to ensure MiningDueTime > ArrangedMiningTime, or can they be equal/inverted? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Data Integrity] Can the LimitMillisecondsOfMiningBlock value be zero or negative in edge cases, preventing any block production? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: TinyBlockCommandStrategy] Can the fallback from TinyBlockCommandStrategy to TerminateRoundCommandStrategy create a scenario where the same miner gets both tiny block and round termination commands? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: MainChainConsensusBehaviourProvider] If MainChainConsensusBehaviourProvider determines NextTerm is needed but the strategy is instantiated with isNewTerm=false, does this create a mismatch in consensus state? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: SideChain] For side chains that should never use NextTerm behavior, is there validation preventing this strategy from being constructed with isNewTerm=true? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessNextTerm] Can the DonateMiningReward logic be manipulated by timing the NextTerm transaction to avoid donating rewards that should be distributed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessNextTerm] Does the Treasury.Release call validate that the period number matches the current term, or can it release rewards for incorrect periods? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessNextRound] Can miners exploit the NextRound transition to reset their ProducedTinyBlocks counter without actually completing a full term? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Error Handling] If ArrangeExtraBlockMiningTime throws an exception, is it caught and handled gracefully, or does it crash the consensus command generation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Validation] Is there validation ensuring that _isNewTerm is only true when the round actually needs to change term based on period expiration? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Validation] Does the strategy validate that CurrentRound.RealTimeMinersInformation is not empty before attempting to access miner information? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ValidateBeforeExecution] Can the ValidateBeforeExecution check be bypassed for TerminateRound commands, allowing invalid consensus transactions to be processed? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessConsensusInformation] Can the ECVrfVerify check for random number validation fail for NextRound/NextTerm transactions generated from this strategy? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessConsensusInformation] If the random number verification fails, does the consensus command still get processed, potentially leading to predictable round transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessNextTerm] Can the UpdateMinersCountToElectionContract call fail silently, causing the election contract to use an outdated miner count? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessNextTerm] When SetMinerList is called during NextTerm, can an attacker manipulate the miners list to include unauthorized addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: ProcessNextTerm] Does the UpdateCurrentMinerInformationToElectionContract correctly update all miner statistics, or can data be lost during term transitions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Mining Limit] Can a miner abuse the 8x larger mining limit for NextTerm blocks to produce excessively large blocks that should be rejected? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Mining Limit] Is there validation ensuring that blocks produced within LimitMillisecondsOfMiningBlock don't exceed other constraints like transaction count or block size? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Base Class: CommandStrategyBase] Can the TinyBlockSlotInterval calculation result in a value larger than MiningInterval due to integer division errors? (Low)",
