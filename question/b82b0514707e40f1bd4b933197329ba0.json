  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Snapshots] [Missing Snapshot] If a snapshot is missing from Snapshots mapping for a specific term, how does this affect reward calculations, and can an attacker exploit missing snapshots to avoid punishment or claim unearned rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: Snapshots] [Snapshot Election Result Manipulation] Can vote amounts in Snapshots.ElectionResult be modified after snapshot creation to change historical rankings and affect candidate reputation or rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinersCount] [Miners Count Manipulation] Can MinersCount be set to zero or an extremely large value, causing no miners to be elected or allowing unlimited miners, breaking consensus entirely? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinersCount] [Miners Count Reduction DoS] When MinersCount is reduced, does the SyncSubsidyInfoAfterReduceMiner properly handle the case where too many candidates are removed from DataCentersRankingList, potentially causing DoS or incorrect subsidy removals? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinersCount] [Miners Count vs Data Center Count] Can MinersCount and GetValidationDataCenterCount() become desynchronized, causing more data centers to receive subsidies than there are actual miner positions available? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinimumLockTime] [Minimum Lock Bypass] Can MinimumLockTime be set to zero or modified after initialization, allowing attackers to gain voting power with extremely short lock periods and immediately withdraw? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MaximumLockTime] [Maximum Lock Overflow] If MaximumLockTime is set to an extremely large value or overflows, could this cause profit end period calculations to overflow, breaking voter welfare distribution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinimumLockTime, MaximumLockTime] [Lock Time Inversion] Can MaximumLockTime be set to less than MinimumLockTime, creating an impossible voting condition where no valid lock periods exist, causing DoS of all voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinimumLockTime, MaximumLockTime] [Lock Time Range Attack] Could an attacker manipulate the MinimumLockTime and MaximumLockTime range to be extremely narrow, restricting voter flexibility and centralizing voting power to specific lock durations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: TimeEachTerm] [Term Duration Manipulation] Can TimeEachTerm be modified after initialization to shorten or lengthen terms, affecting profit period calculations and potentially allowing premature or delayed reward distributions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: TimeEachTerm] [Zero Term Duration] If TimeEachTerm is set to zero, would this cause division-by-zero errors in end period calculations (lockTime.Div(TimeEachTerm)), halting all voting operations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: TimeEachTerm] [Term Duration Overflow] Could an extremely large TimeEachTerm value cause profit end period calculations to overflow or underflow, breaking welfare distribution for voters? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinerElectionVotingItemId] [Voting Item Replacement] Can MinerElectionVotingItemId be changed after registration, redirecting all votes to a different voting item and orphaning existing votes stored in CandidateVotes and ElectorVotes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MinerElectionVotingItemId] [Voting Item Collision] If MinerElectionVotingItemId collides with another voting item ID, could votes intended for miner election be mixed with votes for other purposes, corrupting election results? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Fee Manipulation] Can TransactionFees mapping be modified by unauthorized parties to set prohibitively high fees on critical operations like Vote or AnnounceElection, effectively blocking system access? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: TransactionFees] [Fee Drain] Could an attacker manipulate TransactionFees to set zero fees on operations and then spam the system, causing resource exhaustion DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: MethodFeeController] [Fee Controller Takeover] Can MethodFeeController be changed to an attacker-controlled address, allowing them to modify transaction fees at will and extract value or DoS the election system? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightInterestController] [Interest Controller Hijack] Could VoteWeightInterestController be replaced with a malicious controller that sets zero or negative interest rates, destroying incentives for long-term voting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightInterestList] [Interest Rate Manipulation] Can VoteWeightInterestList be modified to set extremely high interest rates, causing vote weight calculations to overflow and give attackers disproportionate voting power? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightInterestList] [Negative Interest] Could VoteWeightInterestList contain negative interest values, causing vote weight calculations to underflow or produce negative weights, breaking election math? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightInterestList] [Interest Day Collision] If VoteWeightInterestList contains duplicate Day values, which interest rate is used for vote weight calculation, and can this be exploited to manipulate vote power? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightInterestList] [Unsorted Interest List] If VoteWeightInterestList is not properly sorted by Day, could the vote weight calculation use the wrong interest rate, giving some voters unfair advantages? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightProportion] [Proportion Manipulation] Can VoteWeightProportion have zero values for TimeProportion or AmountProportion, causing division-by-zero in vote weight calculations and halting all voting? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightProportion] [Proportion Overflow] Could extremely large values in VoteWeightProportion cause vote weight calculations to overflow, giving attackers massive voting power with small token amounts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContractState.cs] [State: VoteWeightProportion] [Proportion Inversion] If AmountProportion is set much larger than TimeProportion, does this break the intended incentive structure for long-term voting vs. large-amount voting? (Low)"
