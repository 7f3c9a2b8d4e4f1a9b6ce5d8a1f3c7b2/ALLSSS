  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Integer Overflow/Underflow] Could the negative Seconds value (-62135596800L) cause integer underflow when used in arithmetic operations with other timestamps, potentially allowing manipulation of voting time boundaries? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Boundary Condition] Does the MinValue timestamp (0001-01-01) create edge cases in RegisterElectionVotingEvent where votes could be registered with timestamps before this boundary, bypassing voting validation logic? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Integer Overflow] Could the large positive Seconds value (253402300799L) cause integer overflow when added to other timestamps or durations in voting period calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Boundary Condition] Could setting EndTimestamp to MaxValue (9999-12-31) allow votes to remain active indefinitely, preventing proper term transitions or snapshot taking in the Election contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue/MaxValue] [Protobuf Serialization] Could the extreme Seconds values cause serialization/deserialization issues in cross-contract calls or state storage, leading to corrupted timestamp data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Comparison Logic] Could timestamp comparison operations fail or behave unexpectedly when comparing against MinValue's negative Seconds value, allowing votes to be cast outside intended time windows? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [Nanos Field] Could the Nanos value (999999999) cause precision loss or rounding errors when MaxValue is used in time-based calculations for voting locks or term durations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue/MaxValue] [Immutability] Since these return new Timestamp instances each time, could repeated calls create memory pressure or allow callers to modify returned objects, affecting subsequent uses? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue/MaxValue] [Integration] When used in RegisterElectionVotingEvent, could the unbounded time range (MinValue to MaxValue) bypass snapshot taking or term number validation logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue] [Timezone Handling] Does MinValue assume UTC correctly, or could timezone conversion issues allow manipulation of the 0001-01-01 boundary in distributed blockchain environments? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MaxValue] [DOS Vector] Could setting voting EndTimestamp to MaxValue prevent the Vote contract from properly finalizing voting items, causing indefinite resource locks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/TimestampHelper.cs] [Property: MinValue/MaxValue] [State Storage] Could the extreme timestamp values cause inefficient state storage or indexing issues when stored in the Vote contract's VotingItem state? (Low)"
