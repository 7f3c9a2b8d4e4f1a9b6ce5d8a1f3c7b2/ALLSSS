  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Decimal/Numeric Handling] Does IsValidItemId() accept itemId with decimal points (e.g., '12.34')? If regex only checks digits, decimal points would fail, but is there validation for numeric ranges (e.g., itemId > MAX_INT64)? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Regex Validation Gap] IsValidCreateSymbol uses '^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$' and IsValidItemId uses '^[0-9]+$' - can special characters in symbol pass through Split but fail regex, causing misleading Assert errors? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Injection Attack] Can symbol contain regex special characters or escape sequences that break IsValidCreateSymbol/IsValidItemId regex matching, allowing invalid symbols to be classified? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Symbol Collision] Can attacker create symbol 'AB-C' (no collection), then 'AB-0' (collection), then 'AB-1' (NFT) - does the type detection handle this correctly, or can 'AB-C' be misclassified as collection/NFT? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [SEED Token Handling] When creating SEED NFTs with symbol following pattern 'SEED-{itemId}', does GetSymbolType correctly classify SEED-0 as NftCollection per TokenContractConstants.SeedCollectionSymbol, or can there be inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [External Info Dependency] Since CreateNFTInfo relies on GetSymbolType to determine if ownedSymbol in SEED external info is valid (checking != SymbolType.Nft), can manipulating symbol format bypass this check? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Allowance Logic] In GetAllowance() logic, different SymbolType returns trigger different allowance lookups (GetAllSymbolAllowance vs GetNftCollectionAllSymbolAllowance) - can type misclassification allow unauthorized token transfers? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Collection Suffix Constant] The CollectionSymbolSuffix is hardcoded as '0' - if this constant is changed in TokenContractConstants but GetSymbolType still compares against '0', can it cause type detection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Separator Constant] If NFTSymbolSeparator constant changes from '-' to another character, does Split() still work correctly, and is there validation that symbol doesn't contain multiple separator types? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Assert Error Messages] The two Assert error messages 'Invalid Symbol input' and 'Invalid NFT Symbol input' are very similar - can this cause confusion in error handling or make it difficult to identify which validation failed? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Return Value Usage] If downstream code doesn't properly handle all three SymbolType enum values (Token, Nft, NftCollection), can GetSymbolType returning unexpected type cause unhandled exceptions or default case issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Validation Order] The function checks words[0].Length > 0 before IsValidCreateSymbol, and words[1].Length > 0 before IsValidItemId - is this order optimal, or could checking regex first provide better security? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Partial Validation] If words.Length == 2 but IsValidItemId fails, the Assert triggers - but if words.Length > 2, does the function fail gracefully, or can it return incorrect SymbolType? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Cross-Chain Consistency] When tokens are created on side chains, does GetSymbolType produce consistent results across chains, or can different chain IDs embedded in external info affect type classification? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Token Alias] If token has alias defined in external info, does GetSymbolType operate on the alias or actual symbol? Can alias bypass type validation rules? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Batch Operations] In BatchApprove operations, if GetSymbolType is called repeatedly for many symbols, can an attacker craft symbols that cause excessive regex evaluation, leading to DoS? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Approval Wildcard] The approval system supports '*' (all symbols) and 'PREFIX-*' (collection symbols) - does GetSymbolType handle these wildcard symbols correctly, or should they be pre-filtered? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Ternary Logic] The ternary operator checking words[1] == CollectionSymbolSuffix returns NftCollection or Nft - is there any edge case where neither should be returned, such as invalid collection suffix format? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Fail-Safe] If all validation passes but symbol should still be rejected (e.g., reserved keywords), does GetSymbolType have fail-safe checks, or does it assume upstream validation is complete? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Symbol Format Documentation] Is the expected symbol format 'PREFIX-ITEMID' clearly documented? Can developers accidentally create malformed symbols that pass GetSymbolType but fail in other operations? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Performance] Does Split() create new string array on every call? For frequently called operations (transfers, approvals), can this cause performance degradation or excessive memory allocation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Enumeration Safety] The SymbolType enum has values TOKEN(0), NFT(1), NFT_COLLECTION(2) - if code incorrectly casts or compares integer values, can type confusion occur despite correct GetSymbolType classification? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_NFTHelper.cs] [Function: GetSymbolType()] [Return Path Analysis] The function has 3 possible return paths (line 11, 13) - are all paths properly tested? Can edge cases cause unexpected return values not covered by unit tests? (Low)"
