  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: Usage in GetConsensusCommand] [Tiny Block Count] When GetConsensusCommand checks LatestPubkeyToTinyBlocksCount.BlocksCount < 0 at line 33 and forces NextRound, does this interact incorrectly with SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider also returning NextRound? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound] [Missing Term Logic] Unlike MainChainConsensusBehaviourProvider which calls CurrentRound.NeedToChangeTerm with blockchainStartTimestamp and periodSeconds, does SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider's lack of term change logic allow stale miner lists to persist indefinitely on side chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: Constructor] [Missing Parameters] Does the absence of blockchainStartTimestamp and periodSeconds parameters (present in MainChainConsensusBehaviourProvider constructor) prevent side chains from validating consensus timing correctly? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound] [Term Transition] If a side chain's parent chain forces a term change via cross-chain messages, can the SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider's unconditional NextRound return prevent the side chain from synchronizing its miner list? (Critical)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: Constructor] [Cross-Chain State] If currentRound is derived from cross-chain indexed data, can stale or manipulated Round information from the parent chain cause SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider to return incorrect behaviours? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound] [DOS] Can an attacker spam consensus command requests, causing repeated instantiation of SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider and NextRound behaviour returns, forcing premature round transitions and disrupting side chain stability? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: Constructor] [Memory] Can an attacker provide a Round object with maliciously large ActualMiningTimes lists for each miner, causing memory exhaustion when base constructor accesses _minerInRound at line 36?

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound] [Transaction Safety] When GenerateTransactionListByExtraData receives NextRound behaviour from SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider, can the generated NextRound transaction at lines 164-171 be front-run or replayed to cause duplicate round transitions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound] [NextRound Input] Does the NextRoundInput.Create call in GenerateTransactionListByExtraData properly validate the Round and randomNumber when NextRound is returned, or can malformed inputs cause state corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound] [State Transition] Can the unconditional NextRound return cause side chain state transitions to skip necessary UpdateValue or TinyBlock states, leading to incomplete round data?

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/SideChainConsensusBehaviourProvider.cs] [Function: Inherited GetConsensusBehaviour] [Early Return] Can the early return paths in base GetConsensusBehaviour (lines 55, 62, 79, 102, 112, 114) bypass the call to GetConsensusBehaviourToTerminateCurrentRound, making the NextRound override irrelevant in certain scenarios?
