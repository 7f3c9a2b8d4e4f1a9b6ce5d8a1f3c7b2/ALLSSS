  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [Race Condition] If ChangeMethodFeeController() and SetMethodFee() are called in the same block, can the authorization check in SetMethodFee() use the old controller while the state uses the new controller? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [Initialization Gap] Between contract deployment and the first call to RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet(), is there a window where State.MethodFeeController.Value is null and can be exploited? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [Governance Deadlock] If the Parliament contract is upgraded or removed after controller initialization, can this brick the method fee controller permanently? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Cross-Function] [Fee Evasion] Can a user craft transactions that call the hardcoded fee-free methods (ClaimTransactionFees, etc.) as proxies to expensive operations, bypassing fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [State Variable] [Controller Storage] State.MethodFeeController.Value is set but never explicitly validated after initialization - can this be overwritten through contract upgrade or delegate call vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [State Variable] [TransactionFees Mapping] State.TransactionFees[methodName] uses a string key - is there a maximum number of entries to prevent storage exhaustion attacks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [State Variable] [ParliamentContract Reference] State.ParliamentContract.Value is set in RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() but never updated - if Parliament address changes, does this create governance inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [State Variable] [SymbolListToPayTxSizeFee] State.SymbolListToPayTxSizeFee.Value is read in GetTransactionFeeSymbols() but never set in this file - where is it initialized and can it be manipulated? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [MethodFees Structure] Does input.Fees in SetMethodFee() have a maximum length limit, or can an attacker submit thousands of fee tokens to cause gas exhaustion? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Symbol Length] Are there restrictions on the length of symbolToAmount.Symbol in SetMethodFee(), or can extremely long symbols cause storage issues? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Method Name] Does SetMethodFee() validate that input.MethodName matches the contract's actual method signature format, or can arbitrary strings be used? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [AuthorityInfo Validation] In ChangeMethodFeeController(), is there validation that input.OwnerAddress and input.ContractAddress are not equal, preventing self-referential authority? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Input Validation] [Protobuf Defaults] If input parameters are submitted with protobuf default values (empty strings, null addresses), how does the contract handle them? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Error Handling] [Assert vs Require] The code uses Assert() for validation - if Assert throws but doesn't revert state changes, can partial state updates cause inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Error Handling] [Exception in Loop] In SetMethodFee()'s foreach loop, if AssertValidFeeToken() throws for the 3rd of 5 tokens, are the first 2 tokens already validated and what's the final state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Empty Fees List] Can SetMethodFee() be called with input.Fees as an empty list to effectively remove fees for a method, and is this intentional? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Concurrent Calls] If multiple SetMethodFee() calls for the same methodName execute in different transactions in the same block, is there a risk of lost updates? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Edge Case] [Controller Self-Reference] Can ChangeMethodFeeController() set input.OwnerAddress to the TokenContract's own address, creating circular authorization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Economic Attack] [Fee Manipulation] Can a malicious controller set fees to Int64.MaxValue temporarily, extract value by being the fee recipient, then reset fees to normal? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Economic Attack] [Fee Token Rug Pull] Can the controller set fees using a token they control, then manipulate that token's supply or burn rights to break fee collection? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Economic Attack] [Selective Fee Waivers] Can the controller set zero fees for specific methods they intend to use heavily while keeping high fees for others, creating unfair competitive advantage? (High)",
