  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Scheme Lifecycle] [AutoDistributeThreshold Update] Can AutoDistributeThreshold be modified after creation to adapt to changing conditions? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Beneficiary] [AddBeneficiary Line 39-67] Can a scheme have both 'manager-added' beneficiaries (via AddBeneficiary) and 'self-registered' beneficiaries (via RegisterForProfits) simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Beneficiary] [Conflict] If a user is added via AddBeneficiary and then calls RegisterForProfits, which takes precedence and could this cause share calculation errors? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Beneficiary] [RemoveBeneficiary Line 70-98] Can RemoveBeneficiary be called on users who registered via RegisterForProfits, bypassing their lock period? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Beneficiary] [Share Tracking] Are shares tracked separately for AddBeneficiary vs RegisterForProfits, or could manager manipulation affect self-registered users? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Lock Mechanism] [RegisterForProfits Line 157-158] Lock ID generation uses Context.GenerateId with concatenated addresses - is this collision-resistant? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Lock Mechanism] [State.LockIds] LockIds is nested mapping (manager -> user -> lockId) - if a user registers for multiple schemes, is each tracked separately? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Lock Mechanism] [State.LockTimestamp] LockTimestamp is indexed by lockId not by manager+user - could there be confusion if lockIds collide? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Lock Mechanism] [Withdraw Line 238] LockIds is removed but LockTimestamp is not - does this cause state bloat with orphaned timestamps? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Lock Mechanism] [Multi-Lock] Can a user register multiple times by calling RegisterForProfits with different amounts, or does the 'already registered' check prevent this? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Period] [DistributeProfits Line 144] Period is incremented after distribution - could two distributions happen in the same period if called concurrently? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Period] [RegisterForProfits Line 204] Period is incremented during auto-distribution - is this the same period as manual distribution would use? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Period] [UpdateTokenHolderProfitScheme Line 297] Period is synced from originScheme.CurrentPeriod - what if they diverge due to race conditions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Period] [Overflow] Period is int64 - in a long-running system, could period overflow and wrap to negative? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Period] [Backward Period] If originScheme.CurrentPeriod goes backward (bug/attack), could this cause fund loss or distribution issues? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Auto-Distribution] [RegisterForProfits Line 179-206] Auto-distribution triggers on ANY threshold being met - is this the intended behavior or should ALL thresholds be met? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Auto-Distribution] [RegisterForProfits Line 198] AmountsMap is set to 0 for the triggering token - should it distribute the actual balance instead? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Auto-Distribution] [RegisterForProfits Line 199] Break statement exits after first threshold - are subsequent thresholds never checked? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Auto-Distribution] [DOS] Can an attacker game the auto-distribution by registering small amounts repeatedly to trigger distributions at unfavorable times? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Auto-Distribution] [Gas Griefing] If AutoDistributeThreshold has many entries, could RegisterForProfits consume excessive gas even if no distribution occurs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Shares] [AddBeneficiary Line 55] Shares are accumulated without checking for overflow - could this wrap to negative? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Shares] [RemoveBeneficiary Line 93] Sub operation could underflow if input.Amount > lockedAmount despite the check on line 85? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Shares] [RegisterForProfits Line 174] Shares equal input.Amount - should shares be calculated differently based on token decimals or time? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Shares] [Profit Distribution] How are shares converted to actual profit amounts - is the calculation in ProfitContract vulnerable to precision loss? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenHolder/TokenHolderContract.cs] [Shares] [Zero Shares] Can beneficiaries have zero shares, and if so, does this cause division by zero in profit calculations? (Medium)"
