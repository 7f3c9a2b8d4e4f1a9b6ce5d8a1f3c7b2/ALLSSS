  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament_Helper.cs] [Function: CheckProposalAlreadyVotedBy()] [Duplicate Detection] The Contains() check prevents duplicate voting - but if proposal lists contain duplicate entries before this check, can vote counts be inflated? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament_Helper.cs] [Function: CheckProposalAlreadyVotedBy()] [Race Condition] If vote lists are modified between Contains() checks in OR conditions, can a vote be added to multiple lists simultaneously? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateAddressInWhiteList()] [Null Check] Line 203 accesses State.ProposerWhiteList.Value.Proposers - if ProposerWhiteList.Value is null, does this throw null reference exception allowing whitelist bypass? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Parliament/Parliament_Helper.cs] [Function: ValidateAddressInWhiteList()] [Empty List] If State.ProposerWhiteList.Value.Proposers is empty list, the function returns false - can whitelist be cleared to block all whitelisted proposers? (Medium)",
