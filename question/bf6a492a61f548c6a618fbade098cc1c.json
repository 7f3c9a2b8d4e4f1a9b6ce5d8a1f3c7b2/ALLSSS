  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ElectionContract] [Uninitialized Reference] If ElectionContract property is never initialized before first use in consensus operations, could this cause null reference exceptions that halt consensus progress and freeze the blockchain? (Critical)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Uninitialized Reference] If TokenContract is accessed before initialization during consensus reward distribution, could this prevent miners from receiving block rewards and incentivize attack behaviors? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenHolderContract] [Uninitialized Reference] Could uninitialized TokenHolderContract reference cause failures in profit distribution during consensus operations, leading to locked funds? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ElectionContract] [Malicious Contract Injection] If ElectionContract address can be set to a malicious contract during initialization, could an attacker manipulate miner election results to control block production? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TreasuryContract] [Malicious Contract Injection] Could setting TreasuryContract to an attacker-controlled address during setup allow theft of all consensus mining rewards and dividends? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Malicious Contract Injection] If TokenContract reference can be pointed to a fake token contract, could an attacker mint unlimited tokens during consensus reward distribution? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenHolderContract] [Malicious Contract Injection] Could replacing TokenHolderContract with a malicious implementation allow redirection of all staking rewards to attacker addresses? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Malicious Contract Injection] If ParliamentContract can be set to attacker-controlled contract, could this bypass all governance authorization for consensus parameter changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ConfigurationContract] [Malicious Contract Injection] Could injecting malicious ConfigurationContract allow an attacker to return arbitrary consensus parameters (block times, miner counts) causing chain instability? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ElectionContract] [Re-initialization Attack] Can ElectionContract reference be re-assigned after initial setup, allowing attacker to switch to malicious election contract mid-consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TreasuryContract] [Re-initialization Attack] If TreasuryContract property can be modified post-deployment, could an attacker redirect all future mining rewards to their own treasury contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Re-initialization Attack] Could TokenContract be swapped during active consensus rounds, causing reward distribution to fail or use wrong token economics? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenHolderContract] [Re-initialization Attack] If TokenHolderContract can be re-pointed after staking locks are created, could this orphan locked tokens or enable double-claiming of rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Re-initialization Attack] Could Parliament contract reference be replaced mid-governance to bypass ongoing proposal approvals for consensus changes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ConfigurationContract] [Re-initialization Attack] If ConfigurationContract can be swapped, could attacker temporarily use malicious config during critical consensus transitions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ElectionContract] [Interface Compliance] Does the code verify ElectionContract implements required methods before use? Could non-compliant contract cause consensus failures when calling GetVictories() or GetCandidateInformation()? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TreasuryContract] [Interface Compliance] Are there checks that TreasuryContract supports expected dividend distribution methods? Could incompatible contract cause permanent lock of mining rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Interface Compliance] If TokenContract doesn't implement standard Transfer/TransferFrom methods correctly, could consensus rewards fail to distribute silently? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenHolderContract] [Interface Compliance] Could TokenHolderContract that doesn't properly implement profit distribution cause miner reward calculations to return incorrect values? (Medium)",
