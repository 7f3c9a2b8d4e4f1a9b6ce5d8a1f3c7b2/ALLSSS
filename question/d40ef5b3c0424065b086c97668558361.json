  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Initialization Race] Can an attacker call GetMethodFeeController before any fees are set, triggering RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet at line 56 and learning the default controller address for attack planning? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [State Consistency] Does RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet guarantee that State.MethodFeeController.Value is never null after execution, or can edge cases leave it uninitialized causing issues at line 57? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [DOS Attack] Can an attacker set method fees with hundreds of symbols, causing the foreach loops at lines 69 and 82 to consume excessive gas when called, DOS'ing fee calculation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Logic Error] The duplicate check at line 71 uses Contains() which is O(n), can an attacker exploit this with many symbols to create quadratic complexity DOS in fee calculation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Fee Bypass] If methodFee.BasicFee is exactly 0 at line 71, the symbol is excluded - can an attacker set BasicFee to 0 but rely on size fees to create confusion about which tokens are actually required? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Early Return] The early return at line 76 when IsSizeFeeFree is true prevents size fee symbols from being added - is this correct behavior or could it cause fee collection failures? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Null Check] If State.SymbolListToPayTxSizeFee.Value is null at line 80, the function returns early - can this be exploited to avoid paying size fees by preventing initialization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [Duplicate Handling] The Contains check at line 84 prevents duplicate symbols, but if symbols are added in both loops, does this guarantee consistent ordering for fee charging? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetTransactionFeeSymbols()] [State Dependency] If State.TransactionFees[methodName] is modified during execution, could the null check at line 67 be bypassed causing inconsistent fee calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Initialization Attack] Can an attacker call a function that triggers RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet at line 91-93 before Parliament contract is deployed, setting an empty defaultAuthority at line 98 that gives them control? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Race Condition] The check at line 93 returns early if State.MethodFeeController.Value is not null - can two transactions race to initialize this, with one setting a malicious controller? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Missing Validation] The Parliament contract address is fetched via GetContractAddressByName at line 96 - what if this returns an attacker-controlled contract that was registered with the same name? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Null State] If State.ParliamentContract.Value is null after the check at line 101, the defaultAuthority at line 98 remains empty - does this mean OwnerAddress is null/zero, allowing anyone to pass the authorization check? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Cross-Contract Security] The call to GetDefaultOrganizationAddress at line 104 could return an attacker-controlled address if the Parliament contract is malicious - is there validation of this address? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [State Write Timing] State.MethodFeeController.Value is written at line 108 after multiple checks - can a reentrancy during lines 94-104 modify this state before it's finalized? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Comment vs Code] The comment at line 100 says 'Parliament Auth Contract maybe not deployed' - if it's not deployed, what prevents unauthorized fee manipulation with empty defaultAuthority? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Initialization Order] If RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet is called multiple times, does the early return at line 93 prevent re-initialization, or could state corruption occur from repeated calls? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertSenderAddressWith()] [Authorization Bypass] If the address parameter at line 111 is null or zero address, does the equality check at line 113 with Context.Sender fail securely or could it pass if Context.Sender is also uninitialized?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: AssertSenderAddressWith()] [Error Message] The generic error message 'Unauthorized behavior.' at line 113 doesn't specify what authorization failed - could this leak information about internal authorization mechanisms?
