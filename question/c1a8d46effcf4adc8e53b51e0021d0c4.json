(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Property: LastTinyBlockMiningLimit] [Minimum Violation] Can LastTinyBlockMiningLimit be less than TinyBlockMinimumInterval (50ms), violating the minimum 50ms interval constraint for tiny blocks?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/CommandStrategyBase.cs] [Property: LastBlockOfCurrentTermMiningLimit] [Inconsistency] Does LastBlockOfCurrentTermMiningLimit calculation match TerminateRoundCommandStrategy usage, or can mismatch cause term-ending blocks to fail timing validation?
