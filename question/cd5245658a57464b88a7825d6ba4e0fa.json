  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [DoS] Can an attacker supply an unbounded list of IDs in input.Ids causing excessive state reads and gas consumption, potentially timing out the transaction or causing node performance degradation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Null Pointer] If State.VotingRecords[id] returns null for one or more IDs, does AddRange silently add null entries to the collection, potentially causing NullReferenceException in consuming code? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker enumerate all voting record IDs by brute-forcing hash values to discover private or sensitive voting records that should remain confidential? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Data Integrity] If duplicate IDs exist in input.Ids, will the same VotingRecord be returned multiple times, potentially misleading callers about the actual number of unique voting records? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [DoS] Can an attacker submit the same ID millions of times in input.Ids to cause excessive memory allocation when creating the VotingRecords response? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Access Control] Does this method lack any access restrictions, allowing any caller to retrieve voting records including those marked as withdrawn or for closed voting items? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [State Inconsistency] If a voting record is modified between when input.Ids is created and when this query executes, can inconsistent snapshot data be returned across multiple records? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Memory Exhaustion] If input.Ids contains millions of entries and each VotingRecord is large, could this cause out-of-memory errors or exceed maximum message size limits? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Input Validation] Does the method validate that input or input.Ids is not null before calling Select, potentially causing NullReferenceException? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecords()] [Data Leakage] Can this method be used to verify the existence of voting records by observing null vs non-null entries, enabling voter activity tracking? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Privacy Violation] Can any caller retrieve the complete voting history of any address without authorization, exposing private voting patterns and preferences? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Null Handling] If State.VotedItemsMap[input] returns null, does the ?? operator correctly initialize a new VotedItems, or could this mask legitimate data corruption? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker enumerate all voter addresses and their voting activities to build a comprehensive database of voting behavior? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Input Validation] Does the method validate that the input Address is not null or invalid before state access, potentially causing unexpected behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Data Integrity] If the returned VotedItems contains thousands of entries in voted_item_vote_ids map, could this cause performance issues or exceed response size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [State Inconsistency] If a voter's VotedItems is being modified concurrently by Vote() or Withdraw() during this read, can inconsistent data be returned? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [DoS] Can an attacker query addresses that have participated in thousands of voting items, causing excessive state reads and node resource consumption? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Access Control] Should this method restrict queries to the voter themselves or authorized addresses, rather than allowing public access to private voting data? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Data Exposure] Can the returned VotedItems reveal vote IDs that could be used to reconstruct voting patterns or correlate anonymous voters? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotedItems()] [Empty State] For addresses that have never voted, does returning an empty VotedItems leak information about address activity history? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Assertion Bypass] Can the Assert on line 23 be triggered maliciously to cause DoS by repeatedly querying non-existent vote IDs, forcing the contract to throw exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Information Disclosure] Can an attacker enumerate valid voting record hashes by observing which queries succeed vs fail with 'Voting record not found', mapping the voting record space? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Privacy Violation] Does this method allow anyone to retrieve individual voting records including voter address, amount, option, and timestamps without authorization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ViewMethods.cs] [Function: GetVotingRecord()] [Data Integrity] If State.VotingRecords[input] returns a stale or corrupted record, is there validation that the returned data is consistent with the associated VotingItem? (Low)",
