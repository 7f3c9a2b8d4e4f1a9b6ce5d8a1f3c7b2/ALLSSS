  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Dividend Distribution] ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight at line 29 affects when dividends are distributed - can setting this to a high value cause premature dividend payouts before blocks are truly irreversible? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Field Omission Impact] The simplified round omits InValue, ExpectedMiningTime, MissedTimeSlots, and secret sharing data - does this make it impossible to recover the full Round state from the simplified version, breaking consensus recovery mechanisms? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetTinyBlockRound()] [Extreme Simplification] Tiny block rounds only include statistics and exclude all consensus logic fields - can this be exploited to produce tiny blocks that pass header validation but violate consensus rules? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Simplify.cs] [Function: GetUpdateValueRound()] [Asymmetric Information] The target miner's entry (lines 20-32) has more fields than other miners' entries (lines 44-52) - does this information asymmetry enable the target miner to have unfair advantages in consensus or next round selection? (Medium)"
