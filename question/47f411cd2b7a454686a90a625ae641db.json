(Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Gas Griefing] Can an attacker pass input.ContractAddress pointing to a contract with expensive ValidateOrganizationExist implementation, causing high gas costs for legitimate controller changes? (Low)",

(Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Same Controller Update] Can an attacker call ChangeMethodFeeController with the same controller values, wasting gas and triggering unnecessary state writes at line 28? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Null Return] If State.TransactionFees[input.Value] at line 36 returns null for a non-existent method name, can downstream consumers misinterpret this as zero fees and bypass fee collection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Input Validation] If input.Value is null or empty string at line 36, can this cause dictionary lookup errors or return incorrect fee data? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Data Integrity] Can an attacker observe GetMethodFee return values to determine which methods have zero fees, then exploit those methods without paying fees? (Low)",

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Initialization Side Effect] RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() at line 41 has side effects that modify state - can an attacker call this view function to trigger state initialization at a specific time?

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Race Condition] Can multiple concurrent calls to GetMethodFeeController trigger RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() simultaneously, causing duplicate initialization attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Race Condition] Between the null check at line 51 and the assignment at line 59, can multiple transactions exploit a race condition where both check null and both attempt to initialize, potentially overwriting each other?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Parliament Address Manipulation] Can an attacker exploit GetParliamentDefaultAddress() at line 55 if the Parliament contract has not been properly initialized, causing a malicious address to become the default controller? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Contract Address Risk] Does Context.GetContractAddressByName at line 56 validate that the Parliament contract exists, or can this return null/invalid address for ContractAddress?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Null Check Only] The condition at line 51 only checks if Value != null, but doesn't validate if OwnerAddress or ContractAddress within the AuthorityInfo are null - can this cause issues?
