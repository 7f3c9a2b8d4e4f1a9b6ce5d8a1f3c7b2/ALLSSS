  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Initialize()] [Authorization Bypass] Can Initialize() be called multiple times if State.TokenContract.Value is manipulated to null after initialization, allowing an attacker to reset BaseTokenSymbol, FeeRate, and all Connectors? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Initialize()] [Input Validation] Can an attacker initialize the contract with an empty or invalid BaseTokenSymbol by passing an empty string that passes IsValidBaseSymbol() check, potentially breaking all Buy/Sell operations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Initialize()] [Fee Manipulation] Can FeeRate be set to exactly 0 or 1 during initialization since IsBetweenZeroAndOne() only checks > 0 and < 1, causing either no fees or 100% fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Initialize()] [Connector State Corruption] Can an attacker pass duplicate connector symbols in the Connectors array, overwriting earlier connectors and causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Initialize()] [Weight Validation Bypass] Can connectors be initialized with Weight = '0.000...01' (extremely small but still between 0 and 1), causing Bancor calculations to fail or produce incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: UpdateConnector()] [Race Condition] Can UpdateConnector() be called by ConnectorController right before EnableConnector() is executed, modifying Weight/VirtualBalance and causing incorrect deposit calculations? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: UpdateConnector()] [State Inconsistency] After UpdateConnector() modifies a connector's Weight, can the related connector's Weight remain unchanged, causing asymmetric Bancor calculations in Buy/Sell? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: UpdateConnector()] [Authorization Check Missing] Does AssertPerformedByConnectorController() properly initialize State.ConnectorController if it's null, or can this be exploited to bypass authorization? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: UpdateConnector()] [VirtualBalance Manipulation] Can VirtualBalance be updated to an extremely large value before EnableConnector(), causing GetNeededDeposit() to return near-zero deposit requirements? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: UpdateConnector()] [Purchase Enable Check] The assertion 'connector can not be updated because it has been activated' only checks IsPurchaseEnabled - can this be bypassed if both connectors in a pair are not yet enabled? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: AddPairConnector()] [Symbol Collision] Can AddPairConnector() create a connector with Symbol that collides with an existing RelatedSymbol, causing state corruption when Buy/Sell operations look up connectors? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: AddPairConnector()] [Prefix Injection] Can ResourceConnectorSymbol contain NewNtTokenPrefix causing nativeConnectorSymbol to be malformed (e.g., '(NT)(NT)TOKEN')? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: AddPairConnector()] [Zero Virtual Balance] Can NativeVirtualBalance be set to 0 during AddPairConnector(), causing division by zero or incorrect Bancor calculations later? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: AddPairConnector()] [Weight Mismatch Attack] Can attacker-controlled ResourceWeight and NativeWeight be set such that their product enables price manipulation through asymmetric Bancor curves? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: AddPairConnector()] [IsDepositAccount Flag] The nativeTokenToResourceConnector sets IsDepositAccount = true - can this cause GetSelfBalance() to read from State.DepositBalance before any balance is deposited, returning 0? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Reentrancy] Can Buy() be reentered through State.TokenContract.TransferFrom() or State.TokenContract.Transfer() callbacks before State.DepositBalance is updated, allowing double-spending? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Price Manipulation] Can an attacker frontrun a large Buy() transaction with their own Buy() to manipulate the Bancor curve, then backrun with Sell() for profit? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Fee Calculation Overflow] Can amountToPay * GetFeeRate() overflow when converting to Int64, especially with large amounts near Int64.MaxValue? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [PayLimit Bypass] Can PayLimit check be bypassed if PayLimit is set to 0 (treated as 'no limit'), allowing unexpectedly high costs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Balance Update Ordering] State.DepositBalance is updated AFTER token transfers - can this ordering be exploited in cross-contract calls? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Connector State Check] toConnector and fromConnector are loaded without checking if they're null after RelatedSymbol lookup - can this cause null reference exceptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [TransferFrom Authorization] Does TransferFrom require prior approval from Context.Sender? If not approved, does the call revert or silently fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Amount Zero Exploit] Can input.Amount = 0 bypass Bancor calculations and be used to update state or emit events without actual transfers? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [Fee Rounding Error] When fee = Convert.ToInt64(amountToPay * GetFeeRate()), can rounding always floor the fee, allowing users to avoid fees through many small transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.TokenConverter/TokenConverterContract.cs] [Function: Buy()] [HandleFee Failure] If HandleFee() reverts (e.g., TransferFrom fails), does the entire Buy() transaction revert, or are tokens transferred without fees? (Critical)"
