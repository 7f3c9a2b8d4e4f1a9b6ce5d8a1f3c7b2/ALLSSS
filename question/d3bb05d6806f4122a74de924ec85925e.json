  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Protocol Upgrade] If older nodes expect EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces to be present in Round objects, does clearing them break compatibility with pre-upgrade nodes during protocol transitions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Deserialization] Can nodes running older contract versions fail to deserialize Round objects that have had their secret pieces cleared by this method? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Protobuf Clear] Does Clear() on protobuf map fields set them to empty maps or null? If null, does downstream code handle null checks correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Default Values] After Clear(), do EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces return to their protobuf default empty state, or retain some residual metadata? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Line 9] [Performance] Does 'RealTimeMinersInformation.Values.Select(i => i.EncryptedPieces)' create a deferred LINQ query that re-enumerates miners for each foreach iteration, causing O(n²) complexity? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Line 10] [Mutation During Iteration] If foreach modifies RealTimeMinersInformation.Values while iterating (via Clear side effects), can it cause InvalidOperationException? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Line 12] [Redundant Select] Does line 12's Select operation duplicate work from line 9, and could both be combined into a single iteration to reduce gas costs? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Line 13] [Exception Propagation] If Clear() on DecryptedPieces throws, does it prevent Clear() from being called on remaining miners' DecryptedPieces collections? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Method Chaining] Is this method meant to be called after GetUpdateValueRound() or GetTinyBlockRound() to further reduce Round size, and if so, is the call order enforced? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Redundant Operations] Do GetUpdateValueRound/GetTinyBlockRound methods already filter out secret pieces, making this method's work redundant or potentially conflicting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Command Generation] Does clearing secret pieces affect GenerateConsensusCommand logic that may need to inspect EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces to determine next consensus behavior? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Trigger Information] If AElfConsensusTriggerInformation relies on Round having complete secret sharing data, does this method break trigger generation for subsequent blocks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Event Emission] Does SecretSharingInformation event (defined in protobuf) get emitted before or after this method clears data? If after, is critical information missing from the event? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Audit Trail] Does clearing EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces prevent external systems (block explorers, analytics) from auditing the secret sharing process? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Candidate Replacement] If RecordCandidateReplacement updates a miner mid-round, does clearing their EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces prevent the replacement miner from participating in secret sharing? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Evil Miner Removal] If a miner is detected as evil and removed during the round, does this method need to preserve their secret pieces for punishment evidence? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Scalability] If SetMaximumMinersCount allows a very large miner set, can the nested foreach loops cause gas exhaustion or transaction timeout? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Dynamic Miner Count] If miner count increases during round execution, can newly-added miners have their EncryptedPieces cleared before they're set, causing null references? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Unit Test Coverage] Are there unit tests verifying this method doesn't break InValue recovery when called at different consensus lifecycle stages? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Stress Testing] Has this method been tested with maximum miner count scenarios to ensure gas consumption remains within block limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Shallow Copy] If this method is called on a cloned Round object, does it affect the original Round's EncryptedPieces/DecryptedPieces due to shallow copying? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Immutability] Should this method create and return a new Round with cleared secret pieces rather than mutating the existing object? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [Design Pattern] Is clearing secret pieces in-place the correct design, or should a separate 'lightweight' Round type be used that never contains secret pieces? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_GetLighterRound.cs] [Function: DeleteSecretSharingInformation()] [State Management] Does this method properly coordinate with consensus state machine transitions, ensuring it's only called when the round is in a 'finalized' state?
