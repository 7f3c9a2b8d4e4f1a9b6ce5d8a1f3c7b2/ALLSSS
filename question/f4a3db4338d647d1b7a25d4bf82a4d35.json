  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Usage: TokenConverterContract Integration] [Bancor Configuration] Constants define balances but TokenConverter also has internal validation. Could mismatch between constant values and TokenConverter's expected ranges cause initialization rejection? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Usage: ElectionContract Integration] [Token Distribution] ElectionContract receives all VOTE and SHARE tokens. Does ElectionContract have sufficient access controls to prevent unauthorized distribution of these 2 billion tokens? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Global: All Constants] [Test Coverage] Are there unit tests verifying each constant is used correctly in EconomicContract initialization? Could untested constants contain typos or magnitude errors discovered only in production? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Balance Ratios] [Economic Modeling] Have the ratios between NativeTokenConnectorInitialVirtualBalance (100M), NativeTokenToResourceBalance (10M), and ResourceTokenInitialVirtualBalance (0.001) been validated through economic simulations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenConverterFeeRate] [Fee Revenue Projection] Has the 0.5% fee rate been analyzed for long-term sustainability? Could it be too low to cover converter operational costs or too high to encourage trading? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Global: All Constants] [Documentation Gap] Constants lack inline comments explaining rationale for specific values. Could future developers misunderstand intended values and introduce bugs during updates? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Symbol Strings] [Naming Collision] The symbols 'VOTE', 'SHARE', and 'nt' prefix could collide with user-created tokens or other chain ecosystems. Is there documentation warning about reserved symbols? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: MemoMaxLength] [Boundary Testing] Has the 64-byte limit been tested with exactly 64 bytes of UTF-8 data including edge cases like emoji, Chinese characters, and mixed encodings? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Token Supplies] [Maximum Value Testing] Have maximum values like ResourceTokenTotalSupply been tested in multiplication and division operations to ensure no overflow in any code path? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ResourceTokenInitialVirtualBalance] [Minimum Value Testing] The extremely small value of 100_000 (0.001 tokens) represents a near-zero edge case. Has this been tested in Bancor formulas that divide by balance, potentially causing division by near-zero? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Global: Production Constants] [Test Divergence] If test constants differ from production constants, could bugs in production go undetected because tests pass with different values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Global: All Constants] [Configuration Management] Are production constants clearly distinguished from test constants in deployment scripts to prevent accidental use of test values in production? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ResourceTokenTotalSupply] [Immediate Issuance] The full 500M supply is issued immediately to TokenConverter rather than using gradual vesting. Could this create liquidity shocks if TokenConverter is exploited in early blocks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: ElectionTokenTotalSupply] [No Vesting Schedule] Unlike typical token launches with vesting, all 1B VOTE and SHARE tokens are immediately available. Does this create dump risk if ElectionContract distribution logic has bugs? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Usage: Token Ownership] [Owner Centralization] All tokens created by constants set Owner=Context.Self (EconomicContract). Does EconomicContract have sufficient access controls to prevent owner privilege abuse? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Usage: Token Issuance] [Issuer Centralization] All tokens set Issuer=Context.Self (EconomicContract). After initial issuance, can EconomicContract issue more tokens, potentially inflating supply beyond constant values? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Symbol List Names] [Variable Injection] Context.Variables.GetStringArray() retrieves symbol lists at runtime. Could malicious genesis configuration inject symbols containing special characters or excessively long names? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constants: Symbol List Names] [List Order Dependency] If CreateResourceTokens() depends on symbol list order for connector pairing, could reordering symbols in context variables break connector relationships? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenConverterFeeRate] [Fee Recipient] Where do 0.5% fees go? If there's no explicit fee collection mechanism tied to this constant, could fees accumulate in TokenConverter without distribution? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Economic/EconomicContractConstants.cs] [Constant: TokenConverterFeeRate] [Fee Calculation Precision] With 0.5% fee on potentially small trades, could rounding errors cause fees to be 0 for micro-transactions, allowing fee bypass through trade splitting? (Medium)"
