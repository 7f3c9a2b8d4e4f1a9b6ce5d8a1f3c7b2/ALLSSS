  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [InitialMiners Update] Lines 220-226 update InitialMiners only if old pubkey exists - if it doesn't exist but should, can this create consensus miner list desync? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [CandidateVotes Manipulation] Lines 229-235 transfer votes from old to new pubkey - can an attacker exploit vote double-counting by timing replacement during vote tallying? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [CandidateInformation Transfer] Lines 237-243 transfer candidate info - if candidateInformation is null, nothing is transferred, but does this break term counting and reward eligibility for the new pubkey? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [PerformReplacement Side Effects] Line 184 calls PerformReplacement which updates multiple mappings - if any external contract calls fail in PerformReplacement, can partial replacement state persist? (High)",

(High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Double Replacement] Can the same candidate be replaced multiple times in quick succession, creating circular replacement chains that break GetNewestPubkey logic? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: ReplaceCandidatePubkey()] [Old Pubkey Banning Timing] Line 246 bans old pubkey at the end - if the function reverts after this point, is the old pubkey permanently banned even though replacement failed? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: PerformReplacement()] [CandidateReplacementMap Overwrite] Line 282 sets CandidateReplacementMap[newPubkey] = oldPubkey - if newPubkey was itself a replacement of another key, does overwriting this map entry break the replacement chain? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: PerformReplacement()] [CandidateSponsorMap Transfer] Lines 320-321 transfer sponsor - if CandidateSponsorMap[oldPubkey] is null, does this create an invalid sponsor entry for newPubkey? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: PerformReplacement()] [ManagedCandidatePubkeysMap Corruption] Lines 323-326 update managed pubkeys - if managedPubkeys is null, can this cause null reference exception during Remove/Add operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: PerformReplacement()] [Context.Sender Assumption] Line 323 uses Context.Sender assuming it's the admin - but what if this is called from another internal function where Context.Sender is different? (Low)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: GetNewestPubkey()] [No Replacement Validation] No validation that returned newest pubkey is actually a valid, non-banned candidate - can this return banned pubkeys that should be excluded? (High)",
