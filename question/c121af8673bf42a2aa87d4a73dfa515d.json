  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: RecoverAddressFromSignature()] [Signature Malleability] Can an attacker exploit ECDSA signature malleability to create multiple valid signatures for the same ContractOperation, bypassing the one-time signer removal? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ComputeContractOperationHash()] [Hash Collision] Can an attacker craft different ContractOperation objects that produce the same hash, allowing signature reuse across different operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: AddressHelper.ComputeContractAddress()] [Address Collision] Can an attacker find hash collisions in the contract address computation to deploy malicious contracts at predictable or controlled addresses? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: CreateParliamentOrganizationForInitialControllerAddress()] [Whitelist Race Condition] Can an attacker manipulate parliamentProposerWhitelist.Proposers.Count to be 0 right before CreateOrganizationBySystemContract is called, enabling ParliamentMemberProposingAllowed for unauthorized users? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: AssertUserDeployContract()] [Whitelist Bypass] Can an attacker add themselves to Parliament proposer whitelist through a governance attack, then deploy unlimited user contracts on non-main chains? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ValidateProposerAuthority()] [Whitelist Cache Poisoning] Can an attacker manipulate the whitelist validation response from the authorization contract to cache false positives for unauthorized proposers? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: AssertInlineDeployOrUpdateUserContract()] [Inline Call Bypass] Can an attacker on the main chain bypass the inline transaction restriction by manipulating Context.Origin to equal Context.Sender through a proxy contract? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ReleaseApprovedContract()] [Inline Call Attack] Can Context.SendInline to the authorization contract's Release method be exploited to reenter BasicContractZero or manipulate the release process? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ReleaseCodeCheckedContract()] [Inline Call Manipulation] Can an attacker manipulate the inline call to codeCheckController.ContractAddress Release method to trigger unexpected state changes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: DeploySmartContract() in Helper] [Salt Reuse Attack] Can an attacker reuse the same salt value after a contract at that address is somehow removed, deploying a malicious contract at a previously trusted address? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Genesis/BasicContractZero.cs] [Function: ProposeNewContract()] [Salt Prediction] Can an attacker predict or brute-force salt values to deploy contracts at addresses that collide with or are adjacent to high-value contracts? (Medium)"
