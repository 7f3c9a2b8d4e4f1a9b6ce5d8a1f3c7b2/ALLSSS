  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Base Class: CommandStrategyBase] Does the MinersCount property accurately reflect the current number of miners, or can it be outdated if miners were added/removed during the round?

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Function: GetAEDPoSConsensusCommand()] [Authorization] Can a miner who lost their mining privileges mid-round still use a previously generated TerminateRoundCommandStrategy instance to generate valid consensus commands? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: PreCheck] Can the PreCheck validation in ProcessConsensusInformation be bypassed if the miner was in the previous round but not the current round, allowing unauthorized round termination? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusCommandGeneration/Strategies/TerminateRoundCommandStrategy.cs] [Integration: PreCheck] Does the PreCheck method validate that the miner calling NextRound/NextTerm is actually authorized to terminate the round, or just that they're in a miner list?
