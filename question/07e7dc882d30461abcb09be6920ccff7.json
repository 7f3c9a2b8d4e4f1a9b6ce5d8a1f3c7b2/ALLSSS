(Critical)",

(Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [State Transition] Can an attacker exploit the fact that there's no event emission after line 28 to silently change the controller without any on-chain record for external observers to detect the change?

(Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_ACS1_TransactionFeeProvider.cs] [Function: RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet()] [Initialization Vulnerability] Can an attacker exploit the lazy initialization at line 51 where State.MethodFeeController.Value is checked for null, causing repeated calls to set different default authorities if GetParliamentDefaultAddress() returns different values? (High)",
