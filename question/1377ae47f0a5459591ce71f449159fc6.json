  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Authorization Bypass] Can an attacker frontrun ChangeMethodFeeController() to set malicious method fees before the controller transition completes, potentially setting zero fees for critical operations that should be expensive? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Authorization Logic] If State.MethodFeeController.Value.OwnerAddress is set to address zero during initialization, can any sender bypass the authorization check and set arbitrary method fees? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [State Consistency] Can SetMethodFee() be called multiple times in the same block to overwrite method fees, creating race conditions where the final fee state is unpredictable for fee-paying transactions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Input Validation] Does the function validate that input.MethodName is non-empty and corresponds to an actual contract method, or can an attacker set fees for non-existent methods to pollute state storage? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Fee Token Validation] If AssertValidFeeToken() only checks IsBurnable but not token supply or existence, can an attacker set fees using a token with zero supply, causing all transactions using that method to fail? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Denial of Service] Can the method fee controller set extremely high fees (e.g., Int64.MaxValue) for critical system methods like Transfer() or Approve(), effectively bricking the token contract for all users? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [State Pollution] Can an attacker who gains temporary controller access set fees for hundreds of method names, consuming excessive storage and gas, even after losing controller privileges? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Loop Vulnerability] In the foreach loop validating symbolToAmount, if input.Fees contains duplicate symbols with different BasicFee values, which value gets stored and can this create fee inconsistency? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Cross-Contract Call] Does RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() perform external calls that could be exploited for re-entrancy, allowing an attacker to call SetMethodFee recursively? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: SetMethodFee()] [Integer Overflow] Can symbolToAmount.BasicFee be set to negative values or cause overflow when accumulated across multiple fee tokens for a single method? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Authority Takeover] If CheckOrganizationExist() only validates that the organization exists but not its voting threshold or member composition, can an attacker create a malicious organization with single-member control and transfer controller authority? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Validation Gap] Does CheckOrganizationExist() verify that input.ContractAddress is actually an authorization contract (Parliament/Association/Referendum), or can an attacker set it to an arbitrary contract that always returns true for ValidateOrganizationExist? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Timing Attack] Can the current controller call ChangeMethodFeeController() to transfer control to themselves repeatedly, preventing legitimate governance proposals from ever taking effect? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [State Corruption] If RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() is called and State.ParliamentContract.Value is null, can the controller be changed to invalid AuthorityInfo with null ContractAddress, permanently locking the controller? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Re-entrancy] Can the external call to CheckOrganizationExist() enable a re-entrant call to ChangeMethodFeeController() again, allowing the controller to be changed multiple times in a single transaction? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Authorization Race] Can an attacker frontrun a legitimate ChangeMethodFeeController() call by the current owner to change the controller first, effectively stealing governance control? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Input Validation] Is there validation that input.OwnerAddress is not the zero address, or can the controller be set to zero address, permanently losing control over method fees? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: ChangeMethodFeeController()] [Cross-Chain Attack] If input.ContractAddress points to a cross-chain contract on a side-chain, can an attacker manipulate side-chain state to bypass ValidateOrganizationExist and gain unauthorized controller access? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Hardcoded Bypass] The function hardcodes ClaimTransactionFees, DonateResourceToken, ChargeTransactionFees, CheckThreshold, CheckResourceToken, ChargeResourceToken, and CrossChainReceiveToken as IsSizeFeeFree - can this list be manipulated or are there missing critical methods that should also be fee-free? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [State Inconsistency] If State.TransactionFees[input.Value] is null, does the function return null or an empty MethodFees object, and can this cause downstream fee calculation logic to fail or charge incorrect fees? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Bypass Vector] Can an attacker call a fee-paying method using a method name that's slightly different (e.g., case variation, Unicode homoglyph) from the registered fee to bypass fee charging? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [Logic Gap] For the hardcoded fee-free methods, is IsSizeFeeFree=true the only property set, meaning Fees list is empty, and could this cause issues in fee collection logic that expects at least one fee token? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFee()] [DOS via Storage Read] If an attacker previously set method fees for thousands of method names, can GetMethodFee() cause excessive gas consumption when accessing State.TransactionFees? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [Initialization Race] If GetMethodFeeController() is called before any controller is set, RequiredMethodFeeControllerSet() initializes a default controller - can this race condition be exploited to frontrun legitimate controller initialization? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.MultiToken/TokenContract_ACS1_MethodFeeProvider.cs] [Function: GetMethodFeeController()] [State Exposure] Does returning the full AuthorityInfo expose sensitive governance structure that could be used to plan attacks on the Parliament contract? (Low)"
