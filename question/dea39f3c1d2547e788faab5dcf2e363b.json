  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Timing Attack] If currentBlockTime is attacker-controlled or manipulated, can they schedule all mining times in a narrow window to cause network congestion or fork? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Timing Attack] The first miner's time is currentBlockTime + miningInterval (not + 0). Could this gap be exploited for censorship if the extra block producer delays their block? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Timing Attack] If miningInterval is set extremely small (1ms), could the expected mining times be so close that network latency causes miners to produce blocks out of order? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Edge Case] If Pubkeys contains only one miner, does the consensus still function correctly with Order=1, and does the single miner get all block production slots? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Edge Case] If Pubkeys contains more miners than Int32.MaxValue can index, does the for loop fail or wrap causing incorrect Order assignments? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Edge Case] What happens if Pubkeys contains exactly 2 miners with identical first bytes? Does the sort become non-deterministic across nodes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Edge Case] If ByteString.ToHex() returns different case (uppercase vs lowercase) on different platforms, could this cause key mismatches in RealTimeMinersInformation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Access Control] The methods are marked 'internal'. Are there any public wrappers that call this without proper authorization checks, allowing anyone to trigger term transitions? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Access Control] Who controls the MinerList.Pubkeys collection? If it's mutable by external actors, can they manipulate it right before this method is called to control miner ordering? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Determinism] The LINQ orderby and ToDictionary operations - are these guaranteed to produce identical results on all nodes with the same input, or could .NET framework differences cause consensus forks? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Determinism] If two nodes have slightly different currentBlockTime values when calling this method, do they generate Rounds with different ExpectedMiningTime values, causing fork? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Determinism] The sort stability - if multiple pubkeys have the same first byte value, is the relative order preserved consistently across all nodes? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Assumption Violation] The method assumes Pubkeys represents the validated next miner set. If this list hasn't been properly voted on or approved, could unauthorized miners be added to consensus? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Assumption Violation] Does the method assume miningInterval is always positive and reasonable (e.g., 4000ms)? If set to 1 or Int32.MaxValue, could it break consensus timing? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Assumption Violation] The code assumes all ByteString pubkeys are valid, parseable, and unique. If these assumptions are violated, what security failures occur? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [DoS] If Pubkeys contains millions of entries, does the sorting and loop iteration consume excessive gas or CPU, making term transitions economically infeasible? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [DoS] The ToDictionary() and orderby operations allocate temporary collections. With a large Pubkeys list, could this cause out-of-memory errors? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [DoS] Each MinerInRound object is created and added to RealTimeMinersInformation. Could creating thousands of objects exceed contract execution limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Cryptographic] Using only the first byte of pubkeys for sorting reduces 256-bit entropy to 8 bits. Could this make the miner ordering predictable and exploitable? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Cryptographic] Since PreviousInValue is Hash.Empty, the first VRF computation in the new term has no cryptographic binding. Can this be exploited for grinding attacks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Cryptographic] If pubkey generation can be influenced by miners, could they grind keys with specific first bytes to always be sorted first and become the extra block producer? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Interoperability] The Round object returned - if consumed by other contracts or off-chain systems expecting different field values, could initialization choices here cause integration failures? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Interoperability] The method uses extension methods (Add, Mul, AddMilliseconds). If these aren't overflow-safe, could they introduce vulnerabilities not visible in this file? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Code Quality] The comment 'Should be careful during validation' for PreviousInValue = Hash.Empty indicates special handling is needed. If this requirement isn't documented elsewhere, could validators incorrectly reject valid blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/MinerList.cs] [Function: GenerateFirstRoundOfNewTerm()] [Code Quality] The partial class structure means other logic for MinerList exists elsewhere. Could methods in other files modify Pubkeys during this method's execution causing inconsistency? (Medium)"
