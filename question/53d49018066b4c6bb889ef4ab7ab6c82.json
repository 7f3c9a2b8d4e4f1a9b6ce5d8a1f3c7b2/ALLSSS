  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [No Term Validation] There's no check that currentRound and previousRound belong to the same term. Can cross-term reveals corrupt consensus when terms change? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Missing Pubkey Format Validation] publicKey parameter is not validated for format or length. Can invalid pubkey strings cause unexpected behavior in string comparisons (lines 17, 28)? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [No Secret Sharing Enabled Check] The function doesn't call IsSecretSharingEnabled() before processing. Can it reveal secrets even when secret sharing is disabled, violating configuration? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Missing Null Checks] currentRound and previousRound objects are used without null checks. If TryToGetPreviousRoundInformation succeeds but returns a null object, can this cause NullReferenceException? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [UpdateValue Interaction] If UpdateValue is called between getting previousRound and setting PreviousInValue, can this create race conditions or allow double-counting of secrets? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [NextRound Timing] If NextRound is triggered while RevealSharedInValues is executing, can the round transition invalidate the reveals or cause them to be applied to the wrong round? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: IsSecretSharingEnabled()] [Configuration Update Race] If configuration is updated between checking IsSecretSharingEnabled and executing RevealSharedInValues, can this cause reveals to execute when they shouldn't or vice versa? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [DecryptedPieces Update Attack] If another transaction modifies anotherMinerInPreviousRound.DecryptedPieces between lines 36 and 46, can the extracted shared parts be inconsistent? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Concurrent Reveals] If multiple transactions call RevealSharedInValues for different publicKeys simultaneously, can they interfere with each other's state modifications at line 52? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [ByteString Conversion] Line 47 calls ToByteArray() on DecryptedPieces values. If the ByteString is corrupted or malformed, can this return unexpected byte arrays breaking secret reconstruction? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: IsSecretSharingEnabled()] [Protobuf Parsing] Lines 71-75 parse a BoolValue from configuration. If the configuration returns non-BoolValue data, can MergeFrom fail silently or produce incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Hash Serialization] Line 50 passes decoded secret to HashHelper.ComputeFrom. If the secret is null or empty bytes, can this produce a hash of empty data leading to predictable hashes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: IsSecretSharingEnabled()] [StringValue Usage] Line 73-74 creates a StringValue with the configuration key. If the key contains special characters or is too long, can this cause issues in the GetConfiguration call? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [PreviousInValue Already Set] If PreviousInValue is already non-null before line 52, overwriting it could indicate either a legitimate re-reveal or a double-spend attack. Which is it, and how is this prevented? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Partial Update Failure] If the function throws an exception after partially updating some miners' PreviousInValue (line 52), are the updates rolled back or do they persist, creating inconsistent state? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Round State Mutation] The function mutates currentRound but doesn't appear to save it back to state. Is the currentRound parameter a reference to State.Rounds, or are changes lost? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: IsSecretSharingEnabled()] [State.ConfigurationContract Persistence] Line 68 sets State.ConfigurationContract.Value. If this transaction fails later, is this assignment rolled back or does it persist? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Secret Sharing Threshold Mismatch] SecretSharingHelper.DecodeSecret is called with minimumCount (line 50). If the shares were originally encoded with a different threshold, can decoding succeed but produce garbage? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Order List Validation] The 'orders' list (lines 40-44) is passed to DecodeSecret. If orders contains values outside valid range (e.g., negative, zero, or > field prime), can this break Lagrange interpolation? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Share Count vs Threshold] DecodeSecret receives minersCount shares (from DecryptedPieces) but uses minimumCount as threshold. If minersCount >> minimumCount, does this weaken security by providing more shares than necessary? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Polynomial Degree] Shamir's scheme uses a polynomial of degree k-1. If orders and sharedParts lists have different lengths, can this cause DecodeSecret to fail or use wrong polynomial degree? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Skip Self Logic Bypass] Line 28 skips when pair.Key == publicKey. But if a miner changes their publicKey between rounds, they could reveal their own previous round secret, violating the intended skip? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [Continue Without Error] Lines 35-36 use 'continue' to skip miners not meeting threshold. Should these log warnings or emit events for monitoring failed reveals? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: RevealSharedInValues()] [No Duplicate Detection] If previousRound.RealTimeMinersInformation contains duplicate entries (same miner multiple times), the loop processes each, potentially setting PreviousInValue multiple times. Can this be exploited? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs] [Function: IsSecretSharingEnabled()] [Default Return Value] If all checks pass but secretSharingEnabled.Value is uninitialized, line 77 returns the default bool (false). Is false the safe default or should it be true? (Low)"
