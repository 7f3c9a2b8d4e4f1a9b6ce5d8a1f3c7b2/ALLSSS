  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: CalculateNextExtraBlockProducerOrder()] [Randomness Quality] Is Signature cryptographically random enough to prevent extra block producer prediction, or can miners generate multiple signatures offline to find favorable values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: CalculateNextExtraBlockProducerOrder()] [Miner Filtering] Does the m.Signature != null filter at line 113 inadvertently exclude legitimate miners who haven't signed yet, biasing the selection? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: GetMinedMiners()] [SupposedOrderOfNextRound Manipulation] Can a miner set their SupposedOrderOfNextRound to non-zero at line 128 without actually mining, causing them to be incorrectly categorized as mined and receive unearned rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: GetMinedMiners()] [Empty Result] If all miners have SupposedOrderOfNextRound == 0, does returning empty list at line 128 cause GenerateNextRoundInformation to create a round with no 'mined' miners, potentially breaking reward distribution? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/Types/Round_Generation.cs] [Function: GetMinedMiners()] [List Mutation] Is the returned List at line 128 mutable, allowing callers to modify miner categorization after retrieval, corrupting round generation logic? (Medium)",
