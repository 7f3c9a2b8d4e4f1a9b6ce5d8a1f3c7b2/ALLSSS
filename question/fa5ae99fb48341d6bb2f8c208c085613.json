  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Dual Path Inconsistency] Does same configuration change have different validation/effects when called via ConfigurationController vs Zero contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [External Dependency Risk] Relies on Context.GetContractAddressByName and ParliamentContract - if either fails after initial success, can cached values become permanently invalid? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [Single Point of Failure] Only State.ConfigurationController.Value.OwnerAddress has control - if this address loses keys or is compromised, can configuration contract governance be recovered? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Emergency Access Pattern] Zero contract as emergency access - can this be abused if Zero contract has delegatecall or arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [Parliament Dependency] Returns Parliament's default organization as OwnerAddress - if Parliament's GetDefaultOrganizationAddress changes behavior (returns different org), does it break ConfigurationController assumptions? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [ChangeConfigurationController Integration] Used by ChangeConfigurationController which can change itself - can attacker create circular controller change to lock all governance? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [SetConfiguration Integration] Used only by SetConfiguration - if configuration values control other contract behaviors, can Zero contract bypass create privilege escalation chains? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [GetConfigurationController Integration] Main contract's GetConfigurationController returns 'State.ConfigurationController.Value ?? GetDefaultConfigurationController()' - can null check be bypassed to always use default? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [State Visibility] State.ConfigurationController is public SingletonState - can external contracts read and front-run changes based on current controller value? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Configuration Key Control] SetConfiguration accepts arbitrary key-value pairs - can Zero contract set critical system configs that other contracts trust, creating cross-contract exploits? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [Parliament Trust Assumption] Assumes Parliament contract is trustworthy and correctly deployed - what if Parliament itself has vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary proposal execution? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [Controller Lockout Attack] Attacker compromises current controller, calls ChangeConfigurationController to set OwnerAddress to burned address - can configuration contract be permanently frozen? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Zero Contract Proxy Attack] If Zero contract has updateable implementation, can implementation upgrade include malicious SetConfiguration calls to hijack all configurations? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [Contract Name Collision] If SmartContractConstants.ParliamentContractSystemName can be duplicated or spoofed, can GetContractAddressByName return attacker's fake Parliament? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [Governance Takeover] If Parliament's proposal system is exploited to pass malicious ChangeConfigurationController proposal, can attacker permanently seize configuration control? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Deployment Window Attack] During initial deployment before ConfigurationController is set, can attacker race to call SetConfiguration via Zero contract to poison initial state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [Cross-Chain Attack] If Parliament contract is cross-chain, can attacker manipulate cross-chain messages to return malicious GetDefaultOrganizationAddress result? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [Social Engineering] Can attacker convince legitimate controller to approve ChangeConfigurationController proposal that transfers control to attacker's multi-sig? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Configuration Poisoning] Can Zero contract be tricked via callback into calling SetConfiguration with attacker-crafted config that breaks dependent contracts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [State Bloat Attack] Each call potentially creates new AuthorityInfo objects - can repeated calls cause state storage DoS or increased gas costs? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [Flash Loan Attack] Can attacker use flash loan to temporarily control Parliament voting, pass ChangeConfigurationController, execute malicious configs, then revert? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [Gas Griefing] External call to State.ParliamentContract.GetDefaultOrganizationAddress.Call() - can malicious Parliament implementation consume excessive gas causing DoS? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationController()] [State Read Cost] Every call reads State.ConfigurationController.Value - can attacker force frequent reads by spamming failed authorization attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: AssertPerformedByConfigurationControllerOrZeroContract()] [Double State Read] Reads State.ConfigurationController.Value.OwnerAddress and calls GetZeroSmartContractAddress - can this be optimized or exploited for gas manipulation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Configuration/ConfigurationContract_Helper.cs] [Function: GetDefaultConfigurationController()] [Redundant Calls] Function can be called multiple times returning same result - should result be cached more aggressively to prevent redundant cross-contract calls? (Low)"
