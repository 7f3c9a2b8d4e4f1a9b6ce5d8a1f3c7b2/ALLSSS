  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Sybil Attack] If an attacker registers multiple pubkeys as miners and crafts providedRound.RealTimeMinersInformation to exclude some of them, can they bypass per-miner validation for their sybil identities? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Finality Attack] If a malicious miner controls the majority and repeatedly provides providedRound with ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight exactly equal to baseRound value (no progression), can they stall chain finality while passing validation? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Long-Range Attack] The validation doesn't check how far back providedRound's LIB can reference. Can an attacker craft a valid providedRound referencing ancient LIB heights to create alternative history branches? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Nothing-at-Stake] If validation passes for multiple conflicting providedRounds (different branches with same LIB values), could miners produce blocks on multiple forks without penalty? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Grinding Attack] Can miners repeatedly try different providedRound.ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight values until they find one that passes validation at line 26, even if it doesn't reflect true chain state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Censorship] If a miner sets providedRound.RealTimeMinersInformation to exclude certain miners' pubkeys, does this allow them to bypass implied LIB validation for those miners and censor their blocks? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Data Corruption] If providedRound or baseRound are corrupted during serialization/deserialization, could invalid LIB values pass validation due to corrupted comparison values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Dictionary Mutation] At line 23, providedRound.RealTimeMinersInformation is accessed. If this dictionary is mutable and modified during validation, could TOCTOU issues cause inconsistent validation? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Memory Safety] If RealTimeMinersInformation dictionary is very large and validation is called frequently, could memory pressure cause validation failures or crashes? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Term Transition] During term transitions, miner lists change. If baseRound is from term N and providedRound from term N+1, does validation at line 25 fail for new miners who don't exist in baseRound? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Round Transition] When transitioning from round N to N+1, if providedRound.ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockRoundNumber = N+1 but baseRound value = N, is this a legitimate progression or potential attack? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Genesis Block] For the genesis block (round 0 or 1), are ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight and ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockRoundNumber expected to be 0? Does validation handle genesis correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Miner Rotation] If a miner is removed between baseRound and providedRound, their pubkey exists in baseRound but may be absent in providedRound. Does line 23's ContainsKey check correctly handle this rotation scenario? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Validator Ordering] This validator runs after TimeSlotValidationProvider. If time slot validation modifies validationContext, could modified data cause LibInformationValidationProvider to produce incorrect results? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Validation Bypass] If UpdateValueValidationProvider (which runs after this) invalidates the block, are LIB changes from providedRound already applied, causing state inconsistency? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Shared State] Multiple validators access validationContext.BaseRound. If one validator modifies baseRound (e.g., RecoverFromUpdateValue), does this affect LibInformationValidationProvider's validation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Missing Invariant] The validation doesn't check if providedRound.ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight is less than or equal to current block height. Can future LIB heights be provided? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Missing Invariant] No validation ensures ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight <= ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight. Can implied LIB exceed confirmed LIB, violating finality semantics? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Missing Invariant] The validation doesn't verify that all miners in providedRound have consistent LIB values. Can miners provide conflicting ImpliedIrreversibleBlockHeight values? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Missing Invariant] No check ensures providedRound.ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockRoundNumber corresponds to a block at providedRound.ConfirmedIrreversibleBlockHeight. Can mismatched height/round pairs be provided? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Missing Invariant] The validation doesn't check that baseRound and providedRound represent consecutive or properly ordered rounds. Can arbitrarily distant rounds be compared? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Scalability] As the miner count increases, RealTimeMinersInformation dictionary grows. Does line 23's ContainsKey operation scale linearly, potentially causing validation slowdowns with thousands of miners? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Gas Cost] The validation performs dictionary lookups and comparisons. Under adversarial conditions with frequent validation failures, could gas costs for honest miners become prohibitive? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Upgrade Safety] If the contract upgrades and LIB field definitions change (e.g., new fields added to Round), does this validation remain backward-compatible with old blocks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/ConsensusHeaderInfoValidationProviders/LibInformationValidationProvider.cs] [Function: ValidateHeaderInformation()] [Migration] During chain migration, if baseRound is migrated with default/zero LIB values, could all subsequent validations fail at line 16 until proper LIB state is established? (Medium)"
