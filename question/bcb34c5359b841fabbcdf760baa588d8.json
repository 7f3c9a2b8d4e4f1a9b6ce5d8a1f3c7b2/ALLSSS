  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForTitle] [Input Validation] Could the MaxLengthForTitle value of 255 be insufficient to prevent storage bloat attacks where attackers create thousands of proposals with maximum-length titles, potentially causing excessive state growth and increased gas costs for state reads? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Input Validation] Could the MaxLengthForDescription value of 10200 allow attackers to create proposals with extremely large descriptions that cause DoS through excessive gas consumption during proposal retrieval, validation, or event emission operations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForProposalDescriptionUrl] [Input Validation] Could the MaxLengthForProposalDescriptionUrl value of 255 be exploited to store malicious URLs that redirect to phishing sites or execute XSS attacks in frontends that render these URLs without sanitization? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForTitle] [Encoding Attack] Does the length check account for multi-byte UTF-8 characters, or could an attacker bypass the 255-character limit by using multi-byte Unicode characters to store more actual data than intended? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Encoding Attack] Could multi-byte UTF-8 encoding allow an attacker to bypass the 10200 character limit by crafting descriptions with surrogate pairs or combining characters that expand storage beyond intended limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForTitle] [Cross-Contract Consistency] Are these length limits consistent with Parliament and Association contracts, or could inconsistency between governance contracts enable attacks that exploit differences in validation across contract types? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Resource Exhaustion] Could the 10200-character description limit combined with unlimited proposal creation enable attackers to fill contract storage with massive amounts of text data, potentially hitting blockchain state size limits? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constants: All] [Missing Validation] Are there minimum length requirements missing for title, description, and URL fields that could allow empty or single-character proposals to spam the contract? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForProposalDescriptionUrl] [URI Validation] Does the constant alone provide sufficient protection, or could attackers submit 255-character URLs with malformed schemes, data URIs, or javascript: protocols that bypass URL validation checks? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForTitle] [Type Safety] Could the use of 'int' type for length constants (instead of 'uint') introduce negative value vulnerabilities if these constants are used in unchecked arithmetic operations elsewhere? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constant: MaxLengthForDescription] [Gas Cost Attack] Could the 10200-character limit be optimized lower to reduce gas costs for proposal storage and validation without impacting legitimate governance use cases? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/ReferendumConstants.cs] [Constants: All] [Immutability Risk] Are these hardcoded constants upgradeable through governance if spam attacks or storage issues arise, or would changing these limits require a contract upgrade? (Low)"
