  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Re-initialization Attack] Can an attacker front-run the initialization call during deployment and set malicious MinimumLockTime/MaximumLockTime values before the legitimate admin initializes, locking the contract with wrong parameters? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Authorization Bypass] The initialization check only verifies !State.Initialized.Value - if State.Initialized can be manipulated or reset through storage collision, can an attacker re-initialize the contract with different MinerList and TimeEachTerm values? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [State Inconsistency] Lines 34-43 initialize both State.InitialMiners and State.CandidateInformationMap for input.MinerList - if one update fails but the other succeeds, can this create inconsistent state where InitialMiners exist without CandidateInformation? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Input Validation] No validation on input.MinerList count vs input.MinersCount - can an attacker pass mismatched values where MinerList has 10 entries but MinersCount is 100, causing mining schedule corruption? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Duplicate Entry] Lines 39-43 iterate input.MinerList without checking for duplicate pubkeys - can an attacker include the same pubkey multiple times to gain multiple CandidateInformation entries and voting advantages? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Invalid Hex String] Line 37 uses ByteStringHelper.FromHexString(m) without validation - can an attacker pass malformed hex strings causing exceptions that prevent initialization or create invalid pubkey entries? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Time Parameter Manipulation] No validation that MinimumLockTime < MaximumLockTime - can an attacker pass MinimumLockTime >= MaximumLockTime to break vote locking logic in other contract functions? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Zero/Negative Values] No checks preventing input.TimeEachTerm = 0 or negative values - can this cause division by zero or underflow in term calculation logic elsewhere? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [Empty MinerList] No validation preventing input.MinerList from being empty - can initializing with empty list cause the consensus system to fail since MinersCount would be 0? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: InitialElectionContract()] [CurrentTermNumber Manipulation] Line 45 hardcodes CurrentTermNumber to 1 - if external contracts depend on this starting value, can manipulation of this state variable before init break term-based reward calculations? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Double Registration] Line 56 checks !State.VotingEventRegistered.Value but if this state can be reset, can an attacker re-register with different voting parameters (TotalSnapshotNumber, timestamps) to corrupt existing votes? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Race Condition] No authorization check - can any external caller race to call this function immediately after deployment, registering a malicious voting event before the admin? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [VotingItemId Collision] Lines 70-72 compute MinerElectionVotingItemId using HashHelper.ConcatAndCompute - can an attacker craft inputs to State.VoteContract.Register that produce the same hash as an existing voting item, causing vote tallying conflicts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [IsLockToken False] Line 62 sets IsLockToken = false - does this allow voters to vote, immediately withdraw tokens, and vote again with the same tokens, inflating vote counts? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Timestamp Manipulation] Lines 65-66 use TimestampHelper.MinValue/MaxValue for unlimited voting period - can this enable historical vote manipulation if snapshot logic doesn't properly bound vote validity? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [TotalSnapshotNumber Overflow] Line 64 sets TotalSnapshotNumber = long.MaxValue - can this cause integer overflow in snapshot indexing logic if term numbers grow large? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [External Call Failure] Line 68 calls State.VoteContract.Register.Send without checking return value or handling failures - if registration fails silently, does State.VotingEventRegistered still get set to true, breaking all voting? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: RegisterElectionVotingEvent()] [Contract Address Null] Line 58 gets VoteContract address but doesn't validate it's non-null - can calling this before VoteContract deployment cause silent failures or undefined behavior? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Authorization Bypass] Lines 85-88 allow BOTH ConsensusContract OR EmergencyResponseOrganization to call - can a compromised EmergencyResponseOrganization mark legitimate miners as evil nodes without consensus contract involvement? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Evil Node Front-Running] Lines 93-112 ban nodes and remove their benefits - can a malicious consensus contract front-run a legitimate miner's block production to mark them as evil just before they claim rewards? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Integer Overflow] Lines 115-117 use .Add() for ProducedBlocks and MissedTimeSlots without overflow checks - can an attacker cause uint overflow by repeatedly calling with large values, wrapping counters to 0? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [State Inconsistency on Evil Node] Lines 95-111 perform multiple state updates (BannedPubkeyMap, DataCentersRankingList, Candidates, CandidateInformationMap) - if RemoveBeneficiary fails, can nodes remain in some maps but not others? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [DataCenter Manipulation] Lines 98-103 set rankingList.DataCenters[input.Pubkey] = 0 then call UpdateDataCenterAfterMemberVoteAmountChanged - can this be exploited to manipulate subsidy distributions by zeroing out specific nodes? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [Candidate Removal Race] Line 107 removes from CandidateInformationMap but line 90 checks if null and returns early - can concurrent calls cause one to pass the null check while another is removing, leading to double removal attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Election/ElectionContract_Maintainence.cs] [Function: UpdateCandidateInformation()] [ByteString Conversion] Line 95 converts pubkey to byte array - if ByteArrayHelper.HexStringToByteArray fails, can this cause unhandled exception before State.BannedPubkeyMap is updated? (Medium)"
