  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: GenerateSymbolNumber()] [Negative randomNumber] Can Context.ConvertHashToInt64() ever produce negative randomNumber values, and if so, will State.IsCreatedMap handle negative keys correctly? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: MakeSureTokenContractAddressSet()] [Contract Existence Check] Does Context.GetContractAddressByName() verify the contract exists and is deployed, or can it return an address pointing to no contract causing silent failures? (High)",

  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.NFT/NFTContract_Helpers.cs] [Function: MakeSureRandomNumberProviderContractAddressSet()] [Interface Compatibility] Does the function verify that the consensus contract implements the expected GetRandomBytes method, or will calls fail at runtime if the interface changes?
