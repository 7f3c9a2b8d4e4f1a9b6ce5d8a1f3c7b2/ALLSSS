  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_GetMaximumBlocksCount.cs] [Function: GetMaximumBlocksCount()] [Empty Intersection] If the intersection at line 47 yields empty set (no common miners), does factor become 0, then Ceiling(0, count) returns 0, and Math.Min(8, 0) returns 0, completely halting block production? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_GetMaximumBlocksCount.cs] [Function: GetMaximumBlocksCount()] [Recovery Timing] When blockchain recovers from Severe status at lines 72-77, does immediate return of MaximumTinyBlocksCount without checking current status risk allowing excessive blocks if blockchain hasn't fully stabilized? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_GetMaximumBlocksCount.cs] [Function: GetMaximumBlocksCount()] [Partial Recovery] If blockchain is in Abnormal status with IsPreviousBlockInSevereStatus.Value = true (recovering from severe), does the check at line 69 skip Abnormal calculation and return full MaximumTinyBlocksCount prematurely? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_GetMaximumBlocksCount.cs] [Function: GetMaximumBlocksCount()] [Status Degradation] Can blockchain degrade directly from Normal to Severe (skipping Abnormal) if LIB doesn't update for SevereStatusRoundsThreshold rounds, and does this skip the gradual reduction logic intended for Abnormal status? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_GetMaximumBlocksCount.cs] [Function: GetMaximumBlocksCount()] [MinerList Structure] If MinerList.Pubkeys is not a List but an IEnumerable that can only be iterated once, does calling .Intersect() consume the enumerator, causing subsequent access to fail? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Consensus.AEDPoS/AEDPoSContract_GetMaximumBlocksCount.cs] [Function: GetMaximumBlocksCount()] [State Cleanup Race] If MinedMinerListMap cleanup happens between reading currentRoundNumber.Sub(1) and currentRoundNumber.Sub(2) at lines 44-45, can one list be present while the other is deleted, causing asymmetric null references? (Medium)",
