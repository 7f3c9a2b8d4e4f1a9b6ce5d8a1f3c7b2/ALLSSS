  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: CreateNewProposal()] [Input Validation Order] CheckCreateProposalInput is called on line 161 but proposalId generation on line 162 happens before validation - can invalid inputs still generate IDs? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: CreateNewProposal()] [Proposal ID Reuse] Line 163 asserts proposal doesn't exist, but what if a proposal was deleted? Can proposal IDs be reused with different content? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Referendum/Referendum_Helper.cs] [Function: CreateNewProposal()] [Context.Sender Trust] Line 171 uses Context.Sender as Proposer without validation - can the sender be spoofed or manipulated? (Medium)",
