  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Class: VoteContractState] [Partial Class Security] Can malicious code in other partial class definitions of VoteContractState modify or shadow the TokenContract and ParliamentContract properties to redirect contract calls? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Class: VoteContractState] [Property Visibility] Should TokenContract and ParliamentContract be public for transparency or does internal visibility properly protect against external manipulation attempts? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Class: VoteContractState] [State Migration] During contract upgrades, could the serialization/deserialization of TokenContract and ParliamentContract references fail, leaving the upgraded contract without critical external contract access? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Class: VoteContractState] [Null Reference Handling] Are all usages of TokenContract and ParliamentContract throughout the Vote contract properly guarded against null reference exceptions that could DOS the contract? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Name Resolution Attack] When TokenContract.Value is set via Context.GetContractAddressByName(SmartContractConstants.TokenContractSystemName), could an attacker manipulate the system name registry to return a malicious contract address? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Lazy Initialization Exploit] Can an attacker exploit the lazy initialization pattern (checking if Value == null) to force multiple initialization attempts, potentially causing state inconsistencies or gas griefing? (Low)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Missing Initialization] If ParliamentContract is never explicitly initialized like TokenContract is, what are the security implications of using an uninitialized Parliament reference? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Container Type Mismatch] Could an attacker exploit type confusion by providing a contract that implements TokenContractContainer.TokenContractReferenceState interface but behaves maliciously? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Container Type Mismatch] Could an attacker exploit type confusion by providing a contract that implements ParliamentContractContainer.ParliamentContractReferenceState interface but behaves maliciously? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Properties: TokenContract & ParliamentContract] [Interface Compliance] Do the container types enforce strict interface compliance, or could a partially-implemented contract cause undefined behavior when called through these references? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Fee Manipulation] If TokenContract charges transaction fees for Lock/Unlock operations, could an attacker manipulate fee structures through the contract reference to make voting economically prohibitive (DOS via high fees)? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Gas Griefing] Could a malicious TokenContract implementation consume excessive gas during Lock/Unlock operations called through the reference, causing voter transactions to fail and preventing legitimate voting? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Economic Denial of Service] Can an attacker exploit the TokenContract reference to make locking operations artificially expensive, pricing out smaller voters and centralizing voting power? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Balance Verification] Does the Vote contract independently verify token balances and lock states, or does it trust data returned through the TokenContract reference which could be manipulated? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Whitelist Data Integrity] When checking IsInWhiteList through TokenContract, could stale or manipulated whitelist data allow registration of voting items with invalid currencies? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Governance Data Trust] If ParliamentContract provides governance data (e.g., authorized addresses), does the Vote contract validate this data or blindly trust potentially compromised governance state? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Concurrent Access] If multiple transactions concurrently access TokenContract through this reference for Lock operations, could race conditions in the Token contract cause double-locking or failed locks? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Sequential Dependency] If Lock must complete before voting record is saved, but the cross-contract call fails, are there transaction rollback guarantees or could partial state changes corrupt voting integrity? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Properties: TokenContract & ParliamentContract] [Call Ordering] Could an attacker exploit specific call orderings through these references to create inconsistent states between Vote, Token, and Parliament contracts? (Medium)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Contract Upgrade DOS] If TokenContract is upgraded to an incompatible version while Vote contract holds references to the old interface, could this permanently break voting functionality requiring contract redeployment? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Governance Upgrade Attack] Could an attacker exploit a Parliament contract upgrade to change governance rules mid-vote, invalidating ongoing voting items or redistributing voting power? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Class: VoteContractState] [Reference Migration] During Vote contract upgrades, are the TokenContract and ParliamentContract references properly migrated, or could they be lost/reset causing permanent functionality loss? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Reverting Lock Operations] If TokenContract.Lock always reverts for specific addresses or conditions, could an attacker prevent targeted voters from participating in IsLockToken=true voting items? (High)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: TokenContract] [Unlock DOS] Could an attacker prevent withdrawal by making TokenContract.Unlock operations always fail, permanently locking voter funds in the contract? (Critical)",
  "[File: contract/AElf.Contracts.Vote/ContractsReferences.cs] [Property: ParliamentContract] [Governance DOS] If ParliamentContract operations become unavailable (DOS'd or compromised), what Vote contract functionalities dependent on Parliament would fail, potentially freezing governance? (High)"
