## Title
Organization Member List Manipulation Allows Governance Bypass Through Post-Creation Vote Manipulation

## Summary
The Association contract fails to snapshot the organization member list at proposal creation time, allowing dynamic membership changes to manipulate voting outcomes on active proposals. Members added after proposal creation can vote on existing proposals, and removed members' votes are retroactively invalidated during threshold checks.

## Finding Description

The Association contract contains a critical governance flaw where voting authorization and vote counting both check against the current organization member list rather than a snapshot captured at proposal creation time.

**Flaw 1: Dynamic Authorization Check**

When members vote on proposals, the contract verifies membership against the live organization state. The voting methods (`Approve`, `Reject`, `Abstain`) call the authorization helper which queries the current member list. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

This means anyone added to the organization after a proposal's creation can immediately vote on that proposal, violating the governance principle that voting rights are determined at proposal creation time.

**Flaw 2: Vote Counting Filters by Current Membership**

During proposal release, the threshold calculation filters all votes by checking if voters still exist in the current member list:
- Rejections are filtered [3](#0-2) 
- Abstentions are filtered [4](#0-3) 
- Approvals are filtered [5](#0-4) 

If a member is removed from the organization, their previously-cast vote becomes invisible to the threshold calculation, effectively erasing their participation.

**Root Cause: No Member Snapshot**

The ProposalInfo structure only stores a reference to the organization address, not the member list state at creation time. [6](#0-5) 

**Attack Vector: Member Modification Functions**

The organization can modify its membership through three functions, all callable by the organization itself via proposal execution:
- AddMember [7](#0-6) 
- RemoveMember [8](#0-7) 
- ChangeMember [9](#0-8) 

**Exploitation Scenario:**

1. Organization has 5 members (A,B,C,D,E) with thresholds: MinimalApprovalThreshold=2, MaximalRejectionThreshold=1
2. Controversial Proposal P1 is created
3. Voting: A,B approve (2), D,E reject (2) - P1 fails due to rejections > threshold
4. Organization creates Proposal P2 to remove member D
5. P2 passes with A,B,C approving
6. After D's removal, when P1's release is checked, rejection count becomes 1 (only E remains in member list)
7. P1 now passes: rejections(1) ≤ MaximalRejectionThreshold(1), approvals(2) ≥ MinimalApprovalThreshold(2)

Alternatively, new members can be added who then vote on existing proposals they had no stake in when those proposals were created.

## Impact Explanation

This vulnerability enables complete governance bypass with critical consequences:

**Governance Integrity Violation**: The fundamental principle that voting rights and vote weight are fixed at proposal creation time is violated. This makes all governance outcomes potentially unreliable.

**Vote Manipulation**: An organization controlling enough votes to pass one proposal (for membership changes) can manipulate any other pending proposal's outcome by:
- Adding favorable members who vote to support failing proposals
- Removing opposing members to invalidate their rejection votes

**Threshold Circumvention**: The carefully-designed approval/rejection thresholds become meaningless when the effective voter base can be retroactively modified. [10](#0-9) 

**Systemic Impact**: All Association-based governance decisions (treasury allocations, parameter changes, contract upgrades) are affected. This undermines trust in the entire governance framework.

The severity is CRITICAL because it breaks core governance guarantees without requiring any privilege escalation or system compromise.

## Likelihood Explanation

This vulnerability has HIGH likelihood of exploitation:

**Low Barrier to Entry**: Any organization that can pass one proposal (to modify membership) can exploit this. No special privileges or system-level access required.

**Simple Execution**: The attack uses standard, documented functions (`AddMember`, `RemoveMember`, `CreateProposal`, `Release`). No complex exploitation technique needed.

**Natural Opportunity**: In contested governance scenarios, it's common to have multiple pending proposals with different voting patterns. This creates natural opportunities for manipulation.

**Validation Constraints Are Weak**: The validation logic [11](#0-10)  allows adding members freely (increasing member count loosens constraints) and removing members as long as thresholds remain valid for the new count.

**Detection Difficulty**: Member modifications appear as legitimate governance actions. There's no on-chain indicator distinguishing malicious timing-based manipulation from normal operations.

**Realistic Precondition**: Organizations routinely manage membership changes. The attacker needs only to time these changes strategically around pending proposals.

## Recommendation

Implement member list snapshotting at proposal creation time:

1. Add a `repeated aelf.Address member_snapshot` field to the `ProposalInfo` message in the protobuf definition
2. In `CreateNewProposal`, capture and store the current organization member list
3. Modify authorization checks to validate against the snapshot instead of current state
4. Update vote counting logic to filter votes using the snapshot member list rather than the live organization member list

This ensures voting rights are immutably fixed when a proposal is created, preventing retroactive manipulation.

## Proof of Concept

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Test_GovernanceBypass_RemovingMemberInvalidatesVotes()
{
    // Setup organization with 5 members and thresholds
    var members = new[] { Reviewer1, Reviewer2, Reviewer3, 
                         Accounts[4].Address, Accounts[5].Address };
    var orgAddress = await CreateOrganizationAsync(members, 
        minimalApproval: 2, maximalRejection: 1);
    
    // Create controversial proposal P1
    var p1 = await CreateProposalAsync(orgAddress, "Method1");
    
    // Vote on P1: 2 approvals, 2 rejections (should fail)
    await ApproveAsync(p1, Reviewer1KeyPair); // A approves
    await ApproveAsync(p1, Reviewer2KeyPair); // B approves
    await RejectAsync(p1, Accounts[4].KeyPair); // D rejects
    await RejectAsync(p1, Accounts[5].KeyPair); // E rejects
    
    // P1 cannot be released (2 rejections > maximalRejection=1)
    var canRelease1 = await CanReleaseAsync(p1);
    canRelease1.ShouldBeFalse();
    
    // Create P2 to remove member D
    var p2 = await CreateProposalAsync(orgAddress, 
        nameof(AssociationContract.RemoveMember), Accounts[4].Address);
    
    // P2 passes with 3 approvals
    await ApproveAsync(p2, Reviewer1KeyPair);
    await ApproveAsync(p2, Reviewer2KeyPair);
    await ApproveAsync(p2, Reviewer3KeyPair);
    await ReleaseAsync(p2, Reviewer1KeyPair);
    
    // Now P1 can be released! (only 1 rejection counted: E)
    var canRelease2 = await CanReleaseAsync(p1);
    canRelease2.ShouldBeTrue(); // VULNERABILITY: P1 now passes
    
    // P1 can be released successfully
    var result = await ReleaseAsync(p1, Reviewer1KeyPair);
    result.Status.ShouldBe(TransactionResultStatus.Mined);
}
```
