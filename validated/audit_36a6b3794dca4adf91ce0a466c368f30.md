## Title
Non-Extra-Block-Producer Can Usurp Extra Block Privileges Through NextRound Transaction

## Summary
The AEDPoS consensus contract fails to validate that only the designated extra block producer (marked with `IsExtraBlockProducer = true`) can execute NextRound/NextTerm transactions. Any miner whose time slot has passed can trigger round termination, and whoever successfully executes NextRound will be incorrectly recorded as `ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound` in the next round, granting them undeserved privileges including pre-round mining rights and increased tiny block limits.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the consensus command generation and validation flow where multiple security checks fail to enforce extra block producer authorization.

**Root Cause - Unconditional Assignment:**

When generating consensus extra data for NextRound, the contract unconditionally assigns the sender's public key as `ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound` without verifying they are the actual designated extra block producer. [1](#0-0) 

The protocol intentionally designates exactly one miner per round as the extra block producer during round generation, marked with `IsExtraBlockProducer = true` through a deterministic calculation. [2](#0-1) 

**Missing Authorization Checks:**

The behavior determination logic allows any miner whose time slot has passed to receive NextRound behavior through the termination path. [3](#0-2) 

The validation providers for NextRound behavior fail to check if the sender has `IsExtraBlockProducer = true`. The validation only adds `NextRoundMiningOrderValidationProvider` and `RoundTerminateValidationProvider`, neither of which validate extra block producer status. [4](#0-3) 

The `MiningPermissionValidationProvider` only verifies the sender is in the current miner list, not that they are the designated extra block producer. [5](#0-4) 

**Privilege Escalation Path:**

Once incorrectly recorded as `ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound`, the miner gains the privilege to mine blocks before the round officially starts. [6](#0-5) 

Additionally, they receive extended tiny block production limits beyond normal miners. [7](#0-6) 

The system also grants mining permission before the round starts based on this field. [8](#0-7) 

## Impact Explanation

**Consensus Integrity Violation:**
This vulnerability fundamentally breaks the AEDPoS consensus protocol's deterministic round termination mechanism. The extra block producer role is carefully calculated to ensure fair rotation and predictable consensus behavior. When wrong miners assume this role, the consensus schedule becomes unpredictable and the protocol's fairness guarantees are violated.

**Operational Impact:**
Miners who usurp extra block privileges can produce blocks outside their designated time slots, specifically before the round officially starts. This creates opportunities for transaction ordering manipulation, potential censorship during the privilege window, and unfair advantage in block production. The extended tiny block limits compound this advantage by allowing more blocks than intended.

**Reward Misallocation:**
Extra block producers receive rewards for their privileged blocks. When the wrong miner assumes this role, they receive rewards that should have gone to the legitimately designated producer, creating economic unfairness in the consensus system.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Attack Feasibility: HIGH**

This vulnerability is highly exploitable under normal network conditions:

1. **Low Barrier to Entry:** Any miner in the current miner list can attempt this attack. No special governance privileges or compromised keys are required.

2. **Natural Trigger Conditions:** The vulnerability can be triggered naturally through network latency causing the designated extra block producer to be slow, the extra block producer experiencing temporary downtime, or round overtime scenarios where multiple miners simultaneously evaluate their next behavior.

3. **Race Condition Dynamics:** When a round exceeds its expected duration, multiple miners whose time slots have passed can simultaneously receive NextRound behavior. The first to successfully execute their NextRound transaction becomes the recorded extra block producer, regardless of whether they were designated for that role.

4. **Detection Difficulty:** The incorrect assignment appears as valid state on-chain with no distinguishing events or logs to identify usurpation versus legitimate termination.

## Recommendation

Add validation in the NextRound behavior processing to verify that only the designated extra block producer can execute round termination:

1. **Add Extra Block Producer Validation:** Create a new validation provider `ExtraBlockProducerValidationProvider` that checks if the sender has `IsExtraBlockProducer = true` in the current round when executing NextRound behavior.

2. **Update Validation Pipeline:** Add this provider to the validation chain in `ValidateBeforeExecution` for `AElfConsensusBehaviour.NextRound` case.

3. **Alternative Approach:** Modify `GetConsensusExtraDataForNextRound` to verify the sender's `IsExtraBlockProducer` status before assignment, reverting if they lack authorization.

The fix should ensure that `nextRound.ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound` can only be set by miners who have `IsExtraBlockProducer = true` in the current round, maintaining the protocol's deterministic consensus guarantees.

## Proof of Concept

A test would demonstrate:
1. Setup a multi-miner consensus environment with designated extra block producer
2. Advance time past multiple miners' time slots (overtime scenario)
3. Have a non-designated miner execute NextRound transaction
4. Verify they become `ExtraBlockProducerOfPreviousRound` in next round
5. Confirm they gain pre-round mining privileges and extended tiny block limits
6. Show the legitimate designated extra block producer loses these privileges

The vulnerability is confirmed by code analysis showing no validation checks for `IsExtraBlockProducer` status during NextRound execution, allowing any miner whose time slot has passed to usurp this privileged role.
