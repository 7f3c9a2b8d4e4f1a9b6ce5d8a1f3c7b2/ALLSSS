## Title
Threshold Secret Sharing DoS: Incorrect DecryptedPieces Count Check Defeats Fault Tolerance

## Summary
The `RevealSharedInValues()` function in the AEDPoS consensus contract incorrectly requires 100% of miners' decrypted pieces instead of the intended 2/3 threshold. This allows any single miner to DoS the secret revelation mechanism by withholding decrypted pieces, forcing the system to use predictable fallback values and degrading consensus randomness quality.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the secret sharing revelation logic during consensus round transitions. The function is invoked when producing the extra block to transition to the next round. [1](#0-0) 

The code correctly calculates a 2/3 threshold (`minimumCount`) for Shamir's Secret Sharing scheme. [2](#0-1) 

However, the critical bug occurs at the decrypted pieces check, which requires 100% participation (`minersCount`) instead of the threshold (`minimumCount`). [3](#0-2) 

This contradicts the cryptographic design, as the actual secret reconstruction correctly uses only the threshold parameter. [4](#0-3) 

The underlying Shamir's Secret Sharing implementation confirms that only `threshold` pieces are needed for reconstruction through Lagrange interpolation, not all pieces. [5](#0-4) 

The test suite explicitly validates the intended 2/3 threshold behavior, demonstrating that secret recovery should succeed once the minimum count is reached and the loop breaks early once sufficient pieces are collected. [6](#0-5) 

When secrets cannot be revealed due to the incorrect check, the system uses predictable fallback values computed from the miner's public key and block height. [7](#0-6) 

This fallback `PreviousInValue` then feeds into signature calculation. [8](#0-7) 

The signature is computed by XORing the `inValue` with all miners' signatures from the current round, which determines mining behavior. [9](#0-8) 

The signature value directly determines the mining order for the next round through modulo arithmetic. [10](#0-9) 

The validation logic permits empty `PreviousInValue` fields, allowing blocks with unrevealed secrets to pass validation. [11](#0-10) 

Decrypted pieces are added via the `UpdateLatestSecretPieces` method, which simply accepts whatever pieces are provided in the trigger information without enforcing completeness. [12](#0-11) 

## Impact Explanation

**Operational DoS of Secret Revelation**: When any miner withholds their decrypted piece, the count falls below `minersCount`, causing the `continue` statement to skip secret revelation. This can be repeated systematically across rounds to prevent proper secret sharing from functioning.

**Degradation of Consensus Randomness**: The system falls back to predictable values computed from public keys and block heights rather than cryptographically random values from the secret sharing scheme. This reduces the quality of randomness used in consensus, making mining order more predictable.

**Defeat of Fault Tolerance**: The 2/3 threshold design specifically tolerates up to 1/3 Byzantine or offline miners. By requiring 100% participation, the system loses this safety margin and becomes vulnerable to any single point of failure.

**Manipulation of Mining Order**: By selectively preventing certain miners' secrets from being revealed, an attacker can force those miners to use predictable fallback values. Since the signature derived from `PreviousInValue` determines the next round's mining order, this allows potential bias in round transitions.

The entire network's security properties degrade when operating on fallback values instead of proper secret sharing, affecting all consensus participants.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Attacker Capabilities**: Any active miner in the consensus set can execute this attack. No special privileges beyond normal consensus participation are required.

**Attack Complexity**: Trivial. The attacker simply produces blocks normally but intentionally omits specific decrypted pieces from their trigger information. This requires no cryptographic expertise or complex coordination—just selective omission of data during block production.

**Detection Difficulty**: The attack is operationally indistinguishable from legitimate network issues such as packet loss, timing problems, or transient node failures. The validation logic explicitly permits empty `PreviousInValue` fields, so blocks with unrevealed secrets pass all validation checks.

**Economic Rationality**: The attack costs nothing beyond normal consensus participation. There are no penalties for incomplete decrypted pieces, and no on-chain evidence can distinguish malicious withholding from accidental omissions. The attacker can execute the attack repeatedly without consequences.

## Recommendation

Change line 36 in `AEDPoSContract_SecretSharing.cs` from:
```csharp
if (anotherMinerInPreviousRound.DecryptedPieces.Count < minersCount) continue;
```

To:
```csharp
if (anotherMinerInPreviousRound.DecryptedPieces.Count < minimumCount) continue;
```

This aligns the check with the cryptographic design of Shamir's Secret Sharing, where only the threshold number of pieces (2/3 of miners) is needed to reconstruct the secret. The same fix should be applied to the off-chain implementation in `SecretSharingService.cs` at line 162.

## Proof of Concept

The vulnerability can be demonstrated by examining the test case that validates the intended 2/3 threshold behavior. The test shows that secret reconstruction succeeds with only `MinimumCount` pieces (2/3 of total), but the production code incorrectly requires all pieces:

```csharp
// From InValueRecoveryTest.cs - shows intended behavior
foreach (var keyPair in othersKeyPairs)
{
    var cipherMessage = encryptedValues[keyPair.PublicKey.ToHex()];
    var decryptMessage = CryptoHelper.DecryptMessage(ownerKeyPair.PublicKey, keyPair.PrivateKey, cipherMessage);
    decryptedValues.Add(keyPair.PublicKey.ToHex(), decryptMessage);

    if (decryptedValues.Count >= MinimumCount)  // Only threshold needed!
    {
        decryptResult = SecretSharingHelper.DecodeSecret(
            decryptedValues.Values.ToList(),
            Enumerable.Range(1, MinimumCount).ToList(), MinimumCount);
        break;  // Exits early once threshold is met
    }
}
```

The production code contradicts this by checking `DecryptedPieces.Count < minersCount` instead of `< minimumCount`, defeating the fault tolerance design and allowing trivial DoS by withholding a single decrypted piece.
