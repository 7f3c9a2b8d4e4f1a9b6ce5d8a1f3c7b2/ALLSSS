# Audit Report

## Title
Cross-Snapshot Withdrawal Leaves Stale Vote Counts in Subsequent Snapshots

## Summary
The `Withdraw()` function in the Vote contract only updates the voting result for the snapshot where the vote was originally cast, but fails to update subsequent snapshots that have inherited the cumulative `VotersCount` and `VotesAmount` metrics. This causes withdrawn votes to persist in later snapshots' aggregate statistics, leading to inflated governance metrics.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability occurs due to a mismatch between how snapshots inherit cumulative data and how withdrawals update that data.

When `TakeSnapshot()` creates a new snapshot, it copies the previous snapshot's `VotersCount` and `VotesAmount` as carried-over cumulative metrics: [1](#0-0) 

However, when a voter withdraws their vote via `Withdraw()`, the function retrieves the voting result using only the snapshot number stored in the original voting record: [2](#0-1) 

This means `Withdraw()` only updates the voting result of the original snapshot, subtracting the withdrawn vote's amount from `VotesAmount`, `Results`, and potentially `VotersCount`: [3](#0-2) 

**Root Cause:** The withdrawal logic does not iterate through or update any subsequent snapshots that have already carried over the vote counts. Once `TakeSnapshot()` copies the cumulative counts forward, those copies become immutable with respect to withdrawals from earlier snapshots.

**Attack Scenario:**
1. Attacker votes with 10,000 tokens in snapshot N
2. Sponsor calls `TakeSnapshot()` creating snapshot N+1 (inherits VotesAmount=10,000, VotersCount=1)
3. Attacker withdraws the vote from snapshot N
4. Snapshot N correctly shows VotesAmount=0, VotersCount=0
5. Snapshot N+1 incorrectly retains VotesAmount=10,000, VotersCount=1

## Impact Explanation

The inflated metrics can affect systems that rely on accurate voting statistics:

1. **Governance Decisions:** The Election contract exposes `GetVotersCount()` and `GetVotesAmount()` methods that query voting results: [4](#0-3) 

These methods will return inflated values for any snapshot following withdrawals from earlier snapshots.

2. **Quorum Manipulation:** If governance decisions or reward distributions rely on voter participation thresholds, attackers can artificially inflate these metrics by voting in early snapshots, waiting for snapshot inheritance, then withdrawing while leaving later snapshots with inflated counts.

3. **Multi-Snapshot Amplification:** With multiple snapshots, a single vote can be counted multiple times across snapshots even after withdrawal, creating a multiplier effect on aggregate statistics.

While this does not cause direct fund loss, it compromises the integrity of governance metrics that external contracts, dApps, or governance mechanisms may rely upon for decision-making.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Attacker Capabilities:** Any voter can execute this - no special permissions required beyond standard voting operations.

**Attack Complexity:** Very low:
- Vote in snapshot N
- Wait for `TakeSnapshot()` to create snapshot N+1
- Call `Withdraw()` to remove the vote
- Snapshot N+1 retains inflated counts

**Feasibility:** Always feasible when:
- Voting item has multiple snapshots (`TotalSnapshotNumber > 1`)
- Token locking is enabled (voter can withdraw after snapshot) OR token locking is disabled (sponsor can withdraw on behalf)

**Detection Difficulty:** The discrepancy is not easily detectable without comparing snapshot results and tracing vote histories, as inflated values appear as normal aggregate statistics.

The existing test suite demonstrates this scenario without detecting the issue. The `VoteContract_Withdraw_Success_Test` votes, takes a snapshot, then withdraws: [5](#0-4) 

The test only verifies snapshot 1's state after withdrawal (lines 270-278) but doesn't check that snapshot 2 still has the inflated counts.

## Recommendation

Modify the `Withdraw()` function to update all subsequent snapshots that have inherited the vote counts. The fix should:

1. Iterate through all snapshots from `votingRecord.SnapshotNumber + 1` to `votingItem.CurrentSnapshotNumber`
2. For each subsequent snapshot, subtract the withdrawn amount from `VotesAmount` and decrement `VotersCount` if applicable
3. Update all affected voting results in state storage

Example fix approach:
```csharp
// After updating the original snapshot (line 222)
// Update all subsequent snapshots
for (long i = votingRecord.SnapshotNumber + 1; i <= votingItem.CurrentSnapshotNumber; i++)
{
    var subsequentResultHash = GetVotingResultHash(votingRecord.VotingItemId, i);
    var subsequentResult = State.VotingResults[subsequentResultHash];
    if (subsequentResult != null)
    {
        subsequentResult.VotesAmount = subsequentResult.VotesAmount.Sub(votingRecord.Amount);
        if (!votedItems.VotedItemVoteIds[votingRecord.VotingItemId.ToHex()].ActiveVotes.Any())
            subsequentResult.VotersCount = subsequentResult.VotersCount.Sub(1);
        State.VotingResults[subsequentResultHash] = subsequentResult;
    }
}
```

## Proof of Concept

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task Withdraw_Leaves_Inflated_Counts_In_Subsequent_Snapshots()
{
    // Register voting item with 3 snapshots
    var registerItem = await RegisterVotingItemAsync(100, 3, true, DefaultSender, 3);
    var voteUser = Accounts[1].KeyPair;
    var voteAmount = 100L;
    
    // Vote in snapshot 1
    await Vote(voteUser, registerItem.VotingItemId, registerItem.Options[1], voteAmount);
    
    // Verify snapshot 1 has the vote
    var snapshot1Before = await GetVotingResult(registerItem.VotingItemId, 1);
    snapshot1Before.VotesAmount.ShouldBe(voteAmount);
    snapshot1Before.VotersCount.ShouldBe(1);
    
    // Take snapshot 2 (inherits counts from snapshot 1)
    await TakeSnapshot(registerItem.VotingItemId, 1);
    
    // Verify snapshot 2 inherited the counts
    var snapshot2Before = await GetVotingResult(registerItem.VotingItemId, 2);
    snapshot2Before.VotesAmount.ShouldBe(voteAmount); // Inherited from snapshot 1
    snapshot2Before.VotersCount.ShouldBe(1); // Inherited from snapshot 1
    
    // Withdraw the vote
    var voteIds = await GetVoteIds(voteUser, registerItem.VotingItemId);
    await Withdraw(voteUser, voteIds.ActiveVotes.First());
    
    // Verify snapshot 1 is correctly updated
    var snapshot1After = await GetVotingResult(registerItem.VotingItemId, 1);
    snapshot1After.VotesAmount.ShouldBe(0); // Correctly decremented
    snapshot1After.VotersCount.ShouldBe(0); // Correctly decremented
    
    // BUG: Snapshot 2 still has the inflated counts!
    var snapshot2After = await GetVotingResult(registerItem.VotingItemId, 2);
    snapshot2After.VotesAmount.ShouldBe(0); // FAILS: Still shows voteAmount (100)
    snapshot2After.VotersCount.ShouldBe(0); // FAILS: Still shows 1
}
```

This test demonstrates that after withdrawal, snapshot 1 is correctly updated to 0, but snapshot 2 incorrectly retains the withdrawn vote's counts, proving the vulnerability exists.
