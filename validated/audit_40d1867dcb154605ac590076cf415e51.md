# Audit Report

## Title
Unvalidated Signature Field Allows Consensus Manipulation Through Mining Order Control

## Summary
The `Signature` field in `UpdateValueInput` is not validated against the expected calculated value, allowing malicious miners to provide arbitrary signature values that directly determine their position in the next round and influence extra block producer selection. This breaks the fundamental fairness of the AEDPoS consensus mechanism.

## Finding Description

The vulnerability exists in the UpdateValue consensus flow where miners can manipulate their mining order by providing crafted signature values instead of correctly calculated ones.

**Expected Behavior**: The signature should be calculated using `previousRound.CalculateSignature(previousInValue)`, which XORs the previous in value with all miners' signatures from the previous round. [1](#0-0) 

This calculation is performed during consensus block extra data generation. [2](#0-1) 

**Actual Behavior**: The validation provider only performs null/empty checks on the signature field without verifying it matches the expected calculated value. [3](#0-2) 

During validation recovery, the provided signature is blindly copied into the base round. [4](#0-3) 

When processing the UpdateValue, the signature from input is directly assigned without any validation. [5](#0-4) 

**Critical Impact on Mining Order**: The signature value directly determines the miner's position in the next round through modulo arithmetic. [6](#0-5) 

This calculated position becomes both `SupposedOrderOfNextRound` and `FinalOrderOfNextRound`. [7](#0-6) 

**Critical Impact on Extra Block Producer**: The signature is also used to determine which miner becomes the extra block producer for the next round by selecting the first miner's signature and using it in the same modulo calculation. [8](#0-7) 

**Attack Execution**: A malicious miner can:
1. Calculate their desired position X in the next round (1 to minersCount)
2. Reverse the modulo operation: find any signature value S where `abs(S % minersCount) + 1 == X`
3. Submit this crafted signature in their block's consensus extra data
4. The validation passes (only checks non-null/non-empty)
5. The miner obtains their desired position and potentially extra block producer role

The `ValidateConsensusAfterExecution` does not prevent this attack because it runs after the malicious signature has already been written to state and compares identical values rather than validating against the expected calculated signature. [9](#0-8) 

## Impact Explanation

**Consensus Integrity Violation (HIGH)**: This vulnerability breaks the core fairness guarantee of AEDPoS consensus. The mining order is supposed to be determined by the cryptographic combination of previous round signatures, providing unpredictability and fairness. By allowing arbitrary signature values, miners can manipulate their scheduling positions.

**Mining Advantage Exploitation**: Malicious miners can:
- Choose favorable time slots to maximize their block production opportunities
- Increase their chances of becoming the extra block producer (which may receive different rewards or have privileged transaction ordering capabilities)
- Extract MEV (Miner Extractable Value) by controlling transaction ordering
- Coordinate with other malicious miners to dominate consecutive time slots

**Systemic Risk**: If multiple miners collude using this vulnerability, they can systematically manipulate the consensus schedule. This degrades the security guarantees of the blockchain and could enable attacks with less than 51% of legitimate mining power, as attackers control scheduling rather than just hash power.

The impact is **HIGH** because it directly undermines a critical protocol invariant: consensus fairness and unpredictable miner scheduling.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Reachable Entry Point**: The vulnerability is exploitable through the standard `UpdateValue` public method that all authorized miners must call during block production. [10](#0-9) 

**Attacker Capabilities**: The attacker only needs to be an authorized miner in the current round, which is the standard assumption for analyzing miner misbehavior. No additional privileges are required.

**Attack Complexity**: The attack is straightforward:
- The modulo operation is easily reversible: for desired position X and minersCount N, use any signature S = (X - 1) + k*N for integer k
- No cryptographic operations need to be broken
- The attack can be repeated in every round where the malicious miner has a time slot

**Detection Difficulty**: There are no detection mechanisms in place because the signature field is never verified against its expected value. The system cannot distinguish between a correctly calculated signature and a crafted one.

**Economic Rationality**: The attack cost is negligible (just computational overhead to calculate a favorable signature value), while benefits include increased mining revenue, better transaction ordering capabilities, and potential collusion advantages.

Likelihood is assessed as **HIGH** for miners with malicious intent.

## Recommendation

Add signature validation in `UpdateValueValidationProvider` to verify that the provided signature matches the expected calculated value:

```csharp
private bool ValidateSignature(ConsensusValidationContext validationContext)
{
    var publicKey = validationContext.SenderPubkey;
    var extraData = validationContext.ExtraData;
    var providedSignature = extraData.Round.RealTimeMinersInformation[publicKey].Signature;
    var previousInValue = extraData.Round.RealTimeMinersInformation[publicKey].PreviousInValue;
    
    if (previousInValue == null || previousInValue == Hash.Empty)
        return true; // First round or no previous in value
        
    var expectedSignature = validationContext.PreviousRound.CalculateSignature(previousInValue);
    
    return providedSignature == expectedSignature;
}
```

Add this check to the `ValidateHeaderInformation` method before other validations.

## Proof of Concept

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task MaliciousMiner_CanManipulateMiningOrder_ByProvidingArbitrarySignature()
{
    // Setup: Initialize consensus with multiple miners
    var minersCount = 5;
    var miners = GenerateMiners(minersCount);
    await InitializeConsensusAsync(miners);
    
    // Attacker wants to be in position 3 next round
    var desiredPosition = 3;
    var maliciousMiner = miners[0];
    
    // Craft signature: S = (desiredPosition - 1) + k * minersCount for any k
    var craftedSignatureValue = (desiredPosition - 1) + (123 * minersCount);
    var craftedSignature = HashHelper.ComputeFrom(craftedSignatureValue.ToString());
    
    // Create UpdateValueInput with crafted signature
    var updateValueInput = new UpdateValueInput
    {
        OutValue = HashHelper.ComputeFrom("test_out_value"),
        Signature = craftedSignature, // Arbitrary crafted value
        ActualMiningTime = TimestampHelper.GetUtcNow(),
        RoundId = CurrentRoundId,
        SupposedOrderOfNextRound = 1, // Will be overwritten by signature modulo
        // ... other fields
    };
    
    // Submit the UpdateValue with crafted signature
    await MaliciousMiner.UpdateValue.SendAsync(updateValueInput);
    
    // Verify: Check that malicious miner obtained desired position
    var nextRound = await ConsensusContract.GetCurrentRoundInformation.CallAsync(new Empty());
    var maliciousMinerInfo = nextRound.RealTimeMinersInformation[maliciousMiner.PublicKey];
    
    // Vulnerability confirmed: miner controls their position
    Assert.Equal(desiredPosition, maliciousMinerInfo.FinalOrderOfNextRound);
}
```

**Notes**: 
- The signature field is used in two critical calculations: miner's next round position and extra block producer selection
- There is no validation comparing the provided signature against `previousRound.CalculateSignature(previousInValue)`
- The modulo operation `GetAbsModulus(signature.ToInt64(), minersCount) + 1` is easily reversible, allowing miners to choose any position
- This breaks the randomness and fairness guarantees of the AEDPoS consensus mechanism
- The attack is executable by any authorized miner without requiring additional privileges or breaking cryptographic assumptions
