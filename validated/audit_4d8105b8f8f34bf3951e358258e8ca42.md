## Title
Approved Proposals Can Be Cleared Before Execution Due to Missing Release Threshold Check

## Summary
The `ClearProposal` function in Parliament, Association, and Referendum contracts allows anyone to permanently delete fully approved proposals after they expire, without checking if the proposal has reached its release threshold. This creates a race condition where approved governance decisions can be destroyed before execution, breaking the fundamental governance invariant that approved proposals should be executable.

## Finding Description

The `ClearProposal` method in all three governance contracts implements identical flawed logic that only validates expiration without checking approval status: [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

The contracts implement `IsReleaseThresholdReached` functions that perform comprehensive approval validation: [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) 

The `Release` method correctly uses this check before executing proposals: [7](#0-6) 

However, `Release` can only be called on non-expired proposals because `GetValidProposal` validates the proposal hasn't expired: [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) 

This creates a critical race condition:
1. Proposal is created with typical 1-day expiration
2. Members vote and proposal reaches release threshold (ToBeReleased = true)
3. If expiration occurs before proposer calls `Release`, the proposal can NEVER be released because `GetValidProposal` rejects expired proposals
4. Anyone can then call `ClearProposal` and permanently delete the approved proposal

The existing tests only verify that expired proposals CAN be cleared, but never test the scenario where APPROVED proposals are cleared: [10](#0-9) 

## Impact Explanation

**High Impact on Governance Integrity:**

- **Broken Governance Invariant:** The fundamental guarantee that approved proposals (ToBeReleased = true) can be executed is violated. Once a proposal expires, even with sufficient approvals, it becomes permanently unexecutable and deletable.

- **Complete Loss of Governance Work:** All voting effort, time, and resources spent reaching consensus are wasted. Participants who voted thinking their approved decision would execute find their work nullified.

- **No Recovery Mechanism:** Deleted proposals cannot be restored. The entire governance process must restart from scratch: create new proposal, wait for voting period, collect votes again.

- **Griefing Attack Vector:** Malicious actors can deliberately prevent approved governance by simply waiting for expiration and calling `ClearProposal`. This is especially dangerous for contentious proposals where adversaries want to block legitimate governance decisions.

- **Time-Sensitive Decisions Blocked:** Emergency responses, urgent parameter adjustments, or time-critical system upgrades can be indefinitely delayed by repeatedly allowing proposals to expire before execution.

- **Affects All Three Governance Systems:** Parliament (consensus governance), Association (multi-signature governance), and Referendum (token-weighted governance) all suffer from this vulnerability.

## Likelihood Explanation

**Moderate-to-High Likelihood:**

**No Privilege Required:**
- `ClearProposal` is publicly callable by anyone
- No authorization checks beyond expiration
- Zero economic cost beyond gas fees

**Realistic Operational Scenarios:**

1. **Network Congestion:** High transaction volume on AElf chain delays the proposer's `Release` transaction past the 1-day expiration window

2. **Proposer Unavailability:** Proposer monitoring tools fail, proposer is temporarily offline, or traveling across time zones during the critical release window

3. **Strategic Vote Waiting:** Proposer intentionally waits for additional approvals to strengthen consensus legitimacy, accidentally exceeding expiration

4. **Key Management Issues:** Proposer loses temporary access to signing keys or experiences hardware wallet issues during the narrow execution window

5. **Deliberate Adversarial Action:** Opponents of a proposal monitor the blockchain and immediately call `ClearProposal` the moment expiration occurs

**Narrow Time Window:**
- Typical 1-day expiration creates a small window between approval and expiration
- Proposer must actively monitor and execute within this window
- Any delay results in permanent loss of the proposal

**Low Attack Complexity:**
- Single function call: `ClearProposal(proposalId)`
- No complex state manipulation required
- Easily automated by monitoring blockchain state

## Recommendation

Add a check in `ClearProposal` to prevent deletion of approved proposals. The fix should verify that the proposal has NOT reached its release threshold before allowing deletion:

```csharp
public override Empty ClearProposal(Hash input)
{
    var proposal = State.Proposals[input];
    Assert(proposal != null && Context.CurrentBlockTime >= proposal.ExpiredTime, "Proposal clear failed");
    
    // NEW: Prevent deletion of approved proposals
    var organization = State.Organizations[proposal.OrganizationAddress];
    Assert(!IsReleaseThresholdReached(proposal, organization), 
        "Cannot clear approved proposal. Proposal has reached release threshold.");
    
    State.Proposals.Remove(input);
    return new Empty();
}
```

This change should be applied to all three contracts: Parliament, Association, and Referendum.

## Proof of Concept

```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task ClearProposal_DeletesApprovedProposal_Vulnerability()
{
    // Setup organization with low approval threshold
    var minimalApprovalThreshold = 2;
    var organizationAddress = await CreateOrganizationAsync(
        minimalApprovalThreshold, 3, 1, 1);
    
    // Create proposal
    var proposalId = await CreateProposalAsync(
        DefaultSenderKeyPair, organizationAddress);
    
    // Get enough approvals to reach release threshold
    var stub1 = GetAssociationContractTester(Reviewer1KeyPair);
    var stub2 = GetAssociationContractTester(Reviewer2KeyPair);
    await stub1.Approve.SendAsync(proposalId);
    await stub2.Approve.SendAsync(proposalId);
    
    // Verify proposal is approved (ToBeReleased = true)
    var proposal = await AssociationContractStub.GetProposal.CallAsync(proposalId);
    proposal.ToBeReleased.ShouldBeTrue(); // Approved!
    
    // Fast-forward time past expiration
    BlockTimeProvider.SetBlockTime(BlockTimeProvider.GetBlockTime().AddDays(5));
    
    // Release should fail because proposal is expired
    var releaseError = await stub1.Release.SendWithExceptionAsync(proposalId);
    releaseError.TransactionResult.Error.ShouldContain("Invalid proposal");
    
    // BUG: Anyone can clear the APPROVED proposal
    var clearResult = await AssociationContractStub.ClearProposal.SendAsync(proposalId);
    clearResult.TransactionResult.Status.ShouldBe(TransactionResultStatus.Mined);
    
    // Approved proposal is now permanently deleted
    var deletedProposal = await AssociationContractStub.GetProposal.CallAsync(proposalId);
    deletedProposal.ShouldBe(new ProposalOutput()); // Gone!
}
```

## Notes

This vulnerability exists because the design philosophy appears to assume proposers will always execute approved proposals before expiration. However, this assumption is unrealistic in production environments where network conditions, operational constraints, and adversarial actors create scenarios where approved proposals expire before execution. The missing `IsReleaseThresholdReached` check in `ClearProposal` allows permanent deletion of governance decisions that achieved consensus, fundamentally breaking the governance model's integrity.
